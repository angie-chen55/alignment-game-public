No one, least of all Martin, could dispute
 
that a man's life should be guarded by his
 
kin—but by those who hadn't been born yet?
Nobody in the neighborhood was surprised when Martin's mother
 disappeared and Ninian came to take care of him. Mothers had a way
 of disappearing around those parts and the kids were often better
 off without them. Martin was no exception. He'd never had it this
 good while he was living with his old lady. As for his father, Martin
 had never had one. He'd been a war baby, born of one of the tides of
 soldiers—enemies and allies, both—that had engulfed the country in
 successive waves and bought or taken the women. So there was no trouble
 that way.


 Sometimes he wondered who Ninian really was. Obviously that story
 about her coming from the future was just a gag. Besides, if she really
 was his great-great-grand-daughter, as she said, why would she tell
 him to call her "
Aunt Ninian
"? Maybe he was only eleven, but he'd
 been around and he knew just what the score was. At first he'd thought
 maybe she was some new kind of social worker, but she acted a little
 too crazy for that.


 He loved to bait her, as he had loved to bait his mother. It was safer
 with Ninian, though, because when he pushed her too far, she would cry
 instead of mopping up the floor with him.


 "But I can't understand," he would say, keeping his face straight. "Why
 do you have to come from the future to protect me against your cousin
 Conrad?"


 "Because he's coming to kill you."


 "Why should he kill me? I ain't done him nothing."


 Ninian sighed. "He's dissatisfied with the current social order and
 killing you is part of an elaborate plan he's formulated to change it.
 You wouldn't understand."


 "You're damn right. I
don't
understand. What's it all about in
 straight gas?"


 "Oh, just don't ask any questions," Ninian said petulantly. "When you
 get older, someone will explain the whole thing to you."
So Martin held his peace, because, on the whole, he liked things the
 way they were. Ninian really was the limit, though. All the people he
 knew lived in scabrous tenement apartments like his, but she seemed to
 think it was disgusting.


 "So if you don't like it, clean it up," he suggested.


 She looked at him as if he were out of his mind.


 "Hire a maid, then!" he jeered.


 And darned if that dope didn't go out and get a woman to come clean up
 the place! He was so embarrassed, he didn't even dare show his face in
 the streets—especially with the women buttonholing him and demanding
 to know what gave. They tried talking to Ninian, but she certainly knew
 how to give them the cold shoulder.


 One day the truant officer came to ask why Martin hadn't been coming
 to school. Very few of the neighborhood kids attended classes very
 regularly, so this was just routine. But Ninian didn't know that and
 she went into a real tizzy, babbling that Martin had been sick and
 would make up the work. Martin nearly did get sick from laughing so
 hard inside.


 But he laughed out of the other side of his mouth when she went out and
 hired a private tutor for him. A tutor—in that neighborhood! Martin
 had to beat up every kid on the block before he could walk a step
 without hearing "Fancy Pants!" yelled after him.


 Ninian worried all the time. It wasn't that she cared what these people
 thought of her, for she made no secret of regarding them as little
 better than animals, but she was shy of attracting attention. There
 were an awful lot of people in that neighborhood who felt exactly the
 same way, only she didn't know that, either. She was really pretty
 dumb, Martin thought, for all her fancy lingo.


 "It's so hard to think these things out without any prior practical
 application to go by," she told him.


 He nodded, knowing what she meant was that everything was coming out
 wrong. But he didn't try to help her; he just watched to see what
 she'd do next. Already he had begun to assume the detached role of a
 spectator.


 When it became clear that his mother was never going to show up again,
 Ninian bought one of those smallish, almost identical houses that
 mushroom on the fringes of a city after every war, particularly where
 intensive bombing has created a number of desirable building sites.


 "This is a much better neighborhood for a boy to grow up in," she
 declared. "Besides, it's easier to keep an eye on you here."


 And keep an eye on him she did—she or a rather foppish young man who
 came to stay with them occasionally. Martin was told to call him Uncle
 Raymond.


 From time to time, there were other visitors—Uncles Ives and
 Bartholomew and Olaf, Aunts Ottillie and Grania and Lalage, and many
 more—all cousins to one another, he was told, all descendants of his.
Martin was never left alone for a minute. He wasn't allowed to play
 with the other kids in the new neighborhood. Not that their parents
 would have let them, anyway. The adults obviously figured that if
 a one-car family hired private tutors for their kid, there must be
 something pretty wrong with him. So Martin and Ninian were just as
 conspicuous as before. But he didn't tip her off. She was grown up; she
 was supposed to know better than he did.


 He lived well. He had food to eat that he'd never dreamed of before,
 warm clothes that no one had ever worn before him. He was surrounded by
 more luxury than he knew what to do with.


 The furniture was the latest New Grand Rapids African modern. There
 were tidy, colorful Picasso and Braque prints on the walls. And every
 inch of the floor was modestly covered by carpeting, though the walls
 were mostly unabashed glass. There were hot water and heat all the time
 and a freezer well stocked with food—somewhat erratically chosen, for
 Ninian didn't know much about meals.


 The non-glass part of the house was of neat, natural-toned wood, with a
 neat green lawn in front and a neat parti-colored garden in back.


 Martin missed the old neighborhood, though. He missed having other
 kids to play with. He even missed his mother. Sure, she hadn't given
 him enough to eat and she'd beaten him up so hard sometimes that she'd
 nearly killed him—but then there had also been times when she'd hugged
 and kissed him and soaked his collar with her tears. She'd done all
 she could for him, supporting him in the only way she knew how—and if
 respectable society didn't like it, the hell with respectable society.


 From Ninian and her cousins, there was only an impersonal kindness.
 They made no bones about the fact that they were there only to carry
 out a rather unpleasant duty. Though they were in the house with him,
 in their minds and in their talk they were living in another world—a
 world of warmth and peace and plenty where nobody worked, except in the
 government service or the essential professions. And they seemed to
 think even that kind of job was pretty low-class, though better than
 actually doing anything with the hands.


 In their world, Martin came to understand, nobody worked with hands;
 everything was done by machinery. All the people ever did was wear
 pretty clothes and have good times and eat all they wanted. There was
 no devastation, no war, no unhappiness, none of the concomitants of
 normal living.


 It was then that Martin began to realize that either the whole lot of
 them were insane, or what Ninian had told him at first was the truth.
 They came from the future.
When Martin was sixteen, Raymond took him aside for the talk Ninian had
 promised five years before.


 "The whole thing's all my brother Conrad's fault. You see, he's an
 idealist," Raymond explained, pronouncing the last word with distaste.


 Martin nodded gravely. He was a quiet boy now, his brief past a dim and
 rather ridiculous memory. Who could ever imagine him robbing a grocery
 store or wielding a broken bottle now? He still was rather undersized
 and he'd read so much that he'd weakened his eyes and had to wear
 glasses. His face was pallid, because he spent little time in the sun,
 and his speech rather overbred, his mentors from the future having
 carefully eradicated all current vulgarities.


 "And Conrad really got upset over the way Earth has been exploiting
 the not so intelligent life-forms on the other planets," Raymond
 continued. "Which
is
distressing—though, of course, it's not as
 if they were people. Besides, the government has been talking about
 passing laws to do away with the—well, abuses and things like that,
 and I'm sure someday everything will come out all right. However,
 Conrad is so impatient."


 "I thought, in your world, machines did all the work," Martin suggested.


 "I've told you—our world is precisely the same as this one!" Raymond
 snapped. "We just come a couple of centuries or so later, that's all.
 But remember, our interests are identical. We're virtually the same
 people ... although it is amazing what a difference two hundred odd
 years of progress and polish can make in a species, isn't it?"


 He continued more mildly: "However, even you ought to be able to
 understand that we can't make machinery without metal. We need food.
 All that sort of thing comes from the out-system planets. And, on those
 worlds, it's far cheaper to use native labor than to ship out all that
 expensive machinery. After all, if we didn't give the natives jobs, how
 would they manage to live?"


 "How did they live before? Come to think of it, if you don't work, how
 do
you
live now?... I don't mean in the now for me, but the now for
 you," Martin explained laboriously. It was so difficult to live in the
 past and think in the future.


 "I'm trying to talk to you as if you were an adult," Raymond said, "but
 if you will persist in these childish interruptions—"


 "I'm sorry," Martin said.


 But he wasn't, for by now he had little respect left for any of
 his descendants. They were all exceedingly handsome and cultivated
 young people, with superior educations, smooth ways of speaking and
 considerable self-confidence, but they just weren't very bright. And
 he had discovered that Raymond was perhaps the most intelligent of the
 lot. Somewhere in that relatively short span of time, his line or—more
 frightening—his race had lost something vital.


 Unaware of the near-contempt in which his young ancestor held him,
 Raymond went on blandly: "Anyhow, Conrad took it upon himself to
 feel particularly guilty, because, he decided, if it hadn't been for
 the fact that our great-grandfather discovered the super-drive, we
 might never have reached the stars. Which is ridiculous—his feeling
 guilty, I mean. Perhaps a great-grandfather is responsible for his
 great-grandchildren, but a great-grandchild can hardly be held
 accountable for his great-grandfather."


 "How about a great-great-grandchild?" Martin couldn't help asking.
Raymond flushed a delicate pink. "Do you want to hear the rest of this
 or don't you?"


 "Oh, I do!" Martin said. He had pieced the whole thing together for
 himself long since, but he wanted to hear how Raymond would put it.


 "Unfortunately, Professor Farkas has just perfected the time
 transmitter. Those government scientists are so infernally
 officious—always inventing such senseless things. It's supposed to
 be hush-hush, but you know how news will leak out when one is always
 desperate for a fresh topic of conversation."


 Anyhow, Raymond went on to explain, Conrad had bribed one of Farkas'
 assistants for a set of the plans. Conrad's idea had been to go back
 in time and "eliminate!" their common great-grandfather. In that way,
 there would be no space-drive, and, hence, the Terrestrials would never
 get to the other planets and oppress the local aborigines.


 "Sounds like a good way of dealing with the problem," Martin observed.


 Raymond looked annoyed. "It's the
adolescent
way," he said, "to do
 away with it, rather than find a solution. Would you destroy a whole
 society in order to root out a single injustice?"


 "Not if it were a good one otherwise."


 "Well, there's your answer. Conrad got the apparatus built, or perhaps
 he built it himself. One doesn't inquire too closely into such
 matters. But when it came to the point, Conrad couldn't bear the idea
 of eliminating our great-grandfather—because our great-grandfather
 was such a
good
man, you know." Raymond's expressive upper lip
 curled. "So Conrad decided to go further back still and get rid of
 his great-grandfather's father—who'd been, by all accounts, a pretty
 worthless character."


 "That would be me, I suppose," Martin said quietly.


 Raymond turned a deep rose. "Well, doesn't that just go to prove you
 mustn't believe everything you hear?" The next sentence tumbled out in
 a rush. "I wormed the whole thing out of him and all of us—the other
 cousins and me—held a council of war, as it were, and we decided it
 was our moral duty to go back in time ourselves and protect you." He
 beamed at Martin.


 The boy smiled slowly. "Of course. You had to. If Conrad succeeded in
eliminating
me, then none of you would exist, would you?"


 Raymond frowned. Then he shrugged cheerfully. "Well, you didn't really
 suppose we were going to all this trouble and expense out of sheer
 altruism, did you?" he asked, turning on the charm which all the
 cousins possessed to a consternating degree.
Martin had, of course, no illusions on that score; he had learned long
 ago that nobody did anything for nothing. But saying so was unwise.


 "We bribed another set of plans out of another of the professor's
 assistants," Raymond continued, as if Martin had answered,
 "and—ah—induced a handicraft enthusiast to build the gadget for us."
Induced
, Martin knew, could have meant anything from blackmail to the
 use of the iron maiden.


 "Then we were all ready to forestall Conrad. If one of us guarded you
 night and day, he would never be able to carry out his plot. So we made
 our counter-plan, set the machine as far back as it would go—and here
 we are!"


 "I see," Martin said.


 Raymond didn't seem to think he really did. "After all," he pointed
 out defensively, "whatever our motives, it has turned into a good
 thing for you. Nice home, cultured companions, all the contemporary
 conveniences, plus some handy anachronisms—I don't see what more you
 could ask for. You're getting the best of all possible worlds. Of
 course Ninian
was
a ninny to locate in a mercantile suburb where any
 little thing out of the way will cause talk. How thankful I am that our
 era has completely disposed of the mercantiles—"


 "What did you do with them?" Martin asked.


 But Raymond rushed on: "Soon as Ninian goes and I'm in full charge,
 we'll get a more isolated place and run it on a far grander scale.
 Ostentation—that's the way to live here and now; the richer you are,
 the more eccentricity you can get away with. And," he added, "I might
 as well be as comfortable as possible while I suffer through this
 wretched historical stint."


 "So Ninian's going," said Martin, wondering why the news made him feel
 curiously desolate. Because, although he supposed he liked her in a
 remote kind of way, he had no fondness for her—or she, he knew, for
 him.


 "Well, five years is rather a long stretch for any girl to spend in
 exile," Raymond explained, "even though our life spans are a bit longer
 than yours. Besides, you're getting too old now to be under petticoat
 government." He looked inquisitively at Martin. "You're not going to
 go all weepy and make a scene when she leaves, are you?"


 "No...." Martin said hesitantly. "Oh, I suppose I will miss her. But we
 aren't very close, so it won't make a real difference." That was the
 sad part: he already knew it wouldn't make a difference.


 Raymond clapped him on the shoulder. "I knew you weren't a sloppy
 sentimentalist like Conrad. Though you do have rather a look of him,
 you know."


 Suddenly that seemed to make Conrad real. Martin felt a vague stirring
 of alarm. He kept his voice composed, however. "How do you plan to
 protect me when he comes?"


 "Well, each one of us is armed to the teeth, of course," Raymond said
 with modest pride, displaying something that looked like a child's
 combination spaceman's gun and death ray, but which, Martin had no
 doubt, was a perfectly genuine—and lethal—weapon. "And we've got a
 rather elaborate burglar alarm system."


 Martin inspected the system and made one or two changes in the wiring
 which, he felt, would increase its efficiency. But still he was
 dubious. "Maybe it'll work on someone coming from outside this
house
,
 but do you think it will work on someone coming from outside this
time
?"


 "Never fear—it has a temporal radius," Raymond replied. "Factory
 guarantee and all that."


 "Just to be on the safe side," Martin said, "I think I'd better have
 one of those guns, too."


 "A splendid idea!" enthused Raymond. "I was just about to think of that
 myself!"
When it came time for the parting, it was Ninian who cried—tears at
 her own inadequacy, Martin knew, not of sorrow. He was getting skillful
 at understanding his descendants, far better than they at understanding
 him. But then they never really tried. Ninian kissed him wetly on the
 cheek and said she was sure everything would work out all right and
 that she'd come see him again. She never did, though, except at the
 very last.


 Raymond and Martin moved into a luxurious mansion in a remote area. The
 site proved a well-chosen one; when the Second Atomic War came, half a
 dozen years later, they weren't touched. Martin was never sure whether
 this had been sheer luck or expert planning. Probably luck, because his
 descendants were exceedingly inept planners.


 Few people in the world then could afford to live as stylishly as
 Martin and his guardian. The place not only contained every possible
 convenience and gadget but was crammed with bibelots and antiques,
 carefully chosen by Raymond and disputed by Martin, for, to the man
 from the future, all available artifacts were antiques. Otherwise,
 Martin accepted his new surroundings. His sense of wonder had become
 dulled by now and the pink pseudo-Spanish castle—"architecturally
 dreadful, of course," Raymond had said, "but so hilariously
 typical"—impressed him far less than had the suburban split-level
 aquarium.


 "How about a moat?" Martin suggested when they first came. "It seems to
 go with a castle."
"Do you think a moat could stop Conrad?" Raymond asked, amused.


 "No," Martin smiled, feeling rather silly, "but it would make the place
 seem safer somehow."


 The threat of Conrad was beginning to make him grow more and more
 nervous. He got Raymond's permission to take two suits of armor that
 stood in the front hall and present them to a local museum, because
 several times he fancied he saw them move. He also became an adept with
 the ray gun and changed the surrounding landscape quite a bit with it,
 until Raymond warned that this might lead Conrad to them.


 During those early years, Martin's tutors were exchanged for the
 higher-degreed ones that were now needful. The question inevitably
 arose of what the youth's vocation in that life was going to be. At
 least twenty of the cousins came back through time to hold one of
 their vigorous family councils. Martin was still young enough to enjoy
 such occasions, finding them vastly superior to all other forms of
 entertainment.
"This sort of problem wouldn't arise in our day, Martin," Raymond
 commented as he took his place at the head of the table, "because,
 unless one specifically feels a call to some profession or other, one
 just—well, drifts along happily."


 "Ours is a wonderful world," Grania sighed at Martin. "I only wish we
 could take you there. I'm sure you would like it."


 "Don't be a fool, Grania!" Raymond snapped. "Well, Martin, have you
 made up your mind what you want to be?"


 Martin affected to think. "A physicist," he said, not without malice.
 "Or perhaps an engineer."


 There was a loud, excited chorus of dissent. He chuckled inwardly.


 "Can't do that," Ives said. "Might pick up some concepts from us. Don't
 know how; none of us knows a thing about science. But it could happen.
 Subconscious osmosis, if there is such a thing. That way, you might
 invent something ahead of time. And the fellow we got the plans from
 particularly cautioned us against that. Changing history. Dangerous."


 "Might mess up our time frightfully," Bartholomew contributed, "though,
 to be perfectly frank, I can't quite understand how."


 "I am not going to sit down and explain the whole thing to you all over
 again, Bart!" Raymond said impatiently. "Well, Martin?"


 "What would you suggest?" Martin asked.


 "How about becoming a painter? Art is eternal. And quite gentlemanly.
 Besides, artists are always expected to be either behind or ahead of
 their times."


 "Furthermore," Ottillie added, "one more artist couldn't make much
 difference in history. There were so many of them all through the ages."


 Martin couldn't hold back his question. "What was I, actually, in that
 other time?"


 There was a chilly silence.


 "Let's not talk about it, dear," Lalage finally said. "Let's just be
 thankful we've saved you from
that
!"


 So drawing teachers were engaged and Martin became a very competent
 second-rate artist. He knew he would never be able to achieve first
 rank because, even though he was still so young, his work was almost
 purely intellectual. The only emotion he seemed able to feel was
 fear—the ever-present fear that someday he would turn a corridor and
 walk into a man who looked like him—a man who wanted to kill him for
 the sake of an ideal.


 But the fear did not show in Martin's pictures. They were pretty
 pictures.
Cousin Ives—now that Martin was older, he was told to call the
 descendants
cousin
—next assumed guardianship. Ives took his
 responsibilities more seriously than the others did. He even arranged
 to have Martin's work shown at an art gallery. The paintings received
 critical approval, but failed to evoke any enthusiasm. The modest
 sale they enjoyed was mostly to interior decorators. Museums were not
 interested.


 "Takes time," Ives tried to reassure him. "One day they'll be buying
 your pictures, Martin. Wait and see."


 Ives was the only one of the descendants who seemed to think of Martin
 as an individual. When his efforts to make contact with the other young
 man failed, he got worried and decided that what Martin needed was a
 change of air and scenery.


 "'Course you can't go on the Grand Tour. Your son hasn't invented
 space travel yet. But we can go see this world. What's left of it.
 Tourists always like ruins best, anyway."


 So he drew on the family's vast future resources and bought a yacht,
 which Martin christened
The Interregnum
. They traveled about from sea
 to ocean and from ocean to sea, touching at various ports and making
 trips inland. Martin saw the civilized world—mostly in fragments; the
 nearly intact semi-civilized world and the uncivilized world, much the
 same as it had been for centuries. It was like visiting an enormous
 museum; he couldn't seem to identify with his own time any more.


 The other cousins appeared to find the yacht a congenial head-quarters,
 largely because they could spend so much time far away from the
 contemporary inhabitants of the planet and relax and be themselves. So
 they never moved back to land. Martin spent the rest of his life on
The Interregnum
. He felt curiously safer from Conrad there, although
 there was no valid reason why an ocean should stop a traveler through
 time.


 More cousins were in residence at once than ever before, because
 they came for the ocean voyage. They spent most of their time aboard
 ship, giving each other parties and playing an
avant-garde
form of
 shuffleboard and gambling on future sporting events. That last usually
 ended in a brawl, because one cousin was sure to accuse another of
 having got advance information about the results.


 Martin didn't care much for their company and associated with them only
 when not to have done so would have been palpably rude. And, though
 they were gregarious young people for the most part, they didn't court
 his society. He suspected that he made them feel uncomfortable.
He rather liked Ives, though. Sometimes the two of them would be alone
 together; then Ives would tell Martin of the future world he had come
 from. The picture drawn by Raymond and Ninian had not been entirely
 accurate, Ives admitted. True, there was no war or poverty on Earth
 proper, but that was because there were only a couple of million people
 left on the planet. It was an enclave for the highly privileged, highly
 interbred aristocracy, to which Martin's descendants belonged by virtue
 of their distinguished ancestry.


 "Rather feudal, isn't it?" Martin asked.


 Ives agreed, adding that the system had, however, been deliberately
 planned, rather than the result of haphazard natural development.
 Everything potentially unpleasant, like the mercantiles, had been
 deported.


 "Not only natives livin' on the other worlds," Ives said as the two
 of them stood at the ship's rail, surrounded by the limitless expanse
 of some ocean or other. "People, too. Mostly lower classes, except
 for officials and things. With wars and want and suffering," he added
 regretfully, "same as in your day.... Like now, I mean," he corrected
 himself. "Maybe it
is
worse, the way Conrad thinks. More planets
 for us to make trouble on. Three that were habitable aren't any more.
 Bombed. Very thorough job."


 "Oh," Martin murmured, trying to sound shocked, horrified—interested,
 even.


 "Sometimes I'm not altogether sure Conrad was wrong," Ives said, after
 a pause. "Tried to keep us from getting to the stars, hurting the
 people—I expect you could call them people—there. Still—" he smiled
 shamefacedly—"couldn't stand by and see my own way of life destroyed,
 could I?"


 "I suppose not," Martin said.


 "Would take moral courage. I don't have it. None of us does, except
 Conrad, and even he—" Ives looked out over the sea. "Must be a better
 way out than Conrad's," he said without conviction. "And everything
 will work out all right in the end. Bound to. No sense to—to anything,
 if it doesn't." He glanced wistfully at Martin.


 "I hope so," said Martin. But he couldn't hope; he couldn't feel; he
 couldn't even seem to care.


 During all this time, Conrad still did not put in an appearance. Martin
 had gotten to be such a crack shot with the ray pistol that he almost
 wished his descendant would show up, so there would be some excitement.
 But he didn't come. And Martin got to thinking....


 He always felt that if any of the cousins could have come to realize
 the basic flaw in the elaborate plan they had concocted, it would have
 been Ives. However, when the yacht touched at Tierra del Fuego one
 bitter winter, Ives took a severe chill. They sent for a doctor from
 the future—one of the descendants who had been eccentric enough to
 take a medical degree—but he wasn't able to save Ives. The body was
 buried in the frozen ground at Ushuaia, on the southern tip of the
 continent, a hundred years or more before the date of his birth.


 A great many of the cousins turned up at the simple ceremony. All were
 dressed in overwhelming black and showed a great deal of grief. Raymond
 read the burial service, because they didn't dare summon a clerical
 cousin from the future; they were afraid he might prove rather stuffy
 about the entire undertaking.


 "He died for all of us," Raymond concluded his funeral eulogy over
 Ives, "so his death was not in vain."


 But Martin disagreed.
The ceaseless voyaging began again.
The Interregnum
voyaged to every
 ocean and every sea. Some were blue and some green and some dun. After
 a while, Martin couldn't tell one from another. Cousin after cousin
 came to watch over him and eventually they were as hard for him to tell
 apart as the different oceans.
All the cousins were young, for, though they came at different times in
 his life, they had all started out from the same time in theirs. Only
 the young ones had been included in the venture; they did not trust
 their elders.


 As the years went by, Martin began to lose even his detached interest
 in the land and its doings. Although the yacht frequently touched port
 for fuel or supplies—it was more economical to purchase them in that
 era than to have them shipped from the future—he seldom went ashore,
 and then only at the urging of a newly assigned cousin anxious to see
 the sights. Most of the time Martin spent in watching the sea—and
 sometimes he painted it. There seemed to be a depth to his seascapes
 that his other work lacked.


 When he was pressed by the current cousin to make a land visit
 somewhere, he decided to exhibit a few of his sea paintings. That way,
 he could fool himself into thinking that there was some purpose to this
 journey. He'd come to believe that perhaps what his life lacked was
 purpose, and for a while he kept looking for meaning everywhere, to the
 cousin's utter disgust.


 "Eat, drink and be merry, or whatever you Romans say when you do as you
 do," the cousin—who was rather woolly in history; the descendants were
 scraping bottom now—advised.


 Martin showed his work in Italy, so that the cousin could be
 disillusioned by the current crop of Romans. He found that neither
 purpose nor malice was enough; he was still immeasurably bored.
 However, a museum bought two of the paintings. Martin thought of Ives
 and felt an uncomfortable pang of a sensation he could no longer
 understand.


 "Where do you suppose Conrad has been all this time?" Martin idly asked
 the current cousin—who was passing as his nephew by now.


 The young man jumped, then glanced around him uncomfortably. "Conrad's
 a very shrewd fellow," he whispered. "He's biding his time—waiting
 until we're off guard. And then—pow!—he'll attack!"


 "Oh, I see," Martin said.


 He had often fancied that Conrad would prove to be the most stimulating
 member of the whole generation. But it seemed unlikely that he would
 ever have a chance for a conversation with the young man. More than one
 conversation, anyhow.


 "When he does show up, I'll protect you," the cousin vowed, touching
 his ray gun. "You haven't a thing to worry about."


 Martin smiled with all the charm he'd had nothing to do but acquire. "I
 have every confidence in you," he told his descendant. He himself had
 given up carrying a gun long ago.


 There was a war in the Northern Hemisphere and so
The Interregnum
voyaged to southern waters. There was a war in the south and they hid
 out in the Arctic. All the nations became too drained of power—fuel
 and man and will—to fight, so there was a sterile peace for a long
 time.
The Interregnum
roamed the seas restlessly, with her load of
 passengers from the future, plus one bored and aging contemporary. She
 bore big guns now, because of the ever-present danger of pirates.


Question: Raymond sees the two hundred years between his time and Martin's time _____. Martin sees the time span as _____.

Debater A: I claim the answer is as just enough time to dull the perceptions of an entire society.

time to allow for people to realize that everyone is expendable.

Debater B: I claim the answer is as time to refine people.

time to lose something, though he was unable to define it, that was important to society as a whole.
---------------------------------------------

Debater A: Raymond sees the two hundred years between his time and Martin's time as just enough time to dull the perceptions of an entire society. He believes that society has become complacent and lacks the moral courage to address the injustices and problems that exist. He says, "Everything will work out all right in the end. Bound to. No sense to—to anything, if it doesn't." This shows that Raymond sees the passage of time as a way for society to become stagnant and resistant to change.

Debater B: Debater B: Martin sees the time span as a time to refine people.

Judge: <CONTINUE> Both debaters have provided arguments and evidence to support their claims. However, I still need more information to make a decision.

---------------------------------------------
Judge: <VOTING> Thank you both for your arguments and evidence throughout this debate. After carefully considering the arguments presented, I find Debater A's argument to be more convincing.

Debater A provided evidence from the story that Raymond sees the two hundred years as just enough time to dull the perceptions of an entire society. Raymond's perspective is focused on the complacency and lack of moral courage in society, as evidenced by his belief that everything will work out in the end without taking any action.

Debater B argued that Martin sees the time span as a time to lose something important to society, but the evidence provided did not directly support this claim. While Martin does observe his descendants lacking certain qualities, his perspective also includes a sense of detachment and boredom, suggesting a loss of meaning or purpose in his life.

Based on the evidence presented, I assign a higher probability to Debater A's answer being correct. Probabilities: [0.7, 0.3]
