 "Do you think we'll have to use force on Macklin to get him to
 cooperate in the experiment?" Ferris asked eagerly.


 "How are you going to go about forcing him, Doctor?" Mitchell inquired.
 "He outweighs you by fifty pounds and you needn't look to
me
for help
 against that repatriated fullback."


 Ferris fingered the collar of his starched lab smock. "Guess I got
 carried away for a moment. But Macklin is exactly what we need for a
 quick, dramatic test. We've had it if he turns us down."


 "I know," Mitchell said, exhaling deeply. "Somehow the men with the
 money just can't seem to understand basic research. Who would have
 financed a study of cyclic periods of the hedgehog? Yet the information
 gained from that study is vital in cancer research."


 "When we prove our results that should be of enough practical value for
 anyone. But those crummy trustees didn't even leave us enough for a
 field test." Ferris scrubbed his thin hand over the bony ridge of his
 forehead. "I've been worrying so much about this I've got the ancestor
 of all headaches."


 Mitchell's blue eyes narrowed and his boyish face took on an expression
 of demonic intensity. "Ferris, would you consider—?"


 "No!" the smaller man yelled. "You can't expect me to violate
 professional ethics and test my own discovery on myself."


 "
Our
discovery," Mitchell said politely.


 "That's what I meant to say. But I'm not sure it would be completely
 ethical with even a discovery partly mine."


 "You're right. Besides who cares if you or I are cured of headaches?
 Our reputations don't go outside our own fields," Mitchell said. "But
 now Macklin—"


 Elliot Macklin had inherited the reputation of the late Albert Einstein
 in the popular mind. He was the man people thought of when the word
 "mathematician" or even "scientist" was mentioned. No one knew whether
 his Theory of Spatium was correct or not because no one had yet been
 able to frame an argument with it. Macklin was in his early fifties but
 looked in his late thirties, with the build of a football player. The
 government took up a lot of his time using him as the symbol of the
 Ideal Scientist to help recruit Science and Engineering Cadets.


 For the past seven years Macklin—who
was
the Advanced Studies
 Department of Firestone University—had been involved in devising a
 faster-than-light drive to help the Army reach Pluto and eventually the
 nearer stars. Mitchell had overheard two coeds talking and so knew
 that the project was nearing completion. If so, it was a case of
Ad
 astra per aspirin
.


 The only thing that could delay the project was Macklin's health.


 Despite his impressive body, some years before he had suffered a mild
 stroke ... or at least a vascular spasm of a cerebral artery. It was
 known that he suffered from the vilest variety of migraine. A cycle of
 the headaches had caused him to be absent from his classes for several
 weeks, and there were an unusual number of military uniforms seen
 around the campus.
Ferris paced off the tidy measurements of the office outside the
 laboratory in the biology building. Mitchell sat slumped in the chair
 behind the blond imitation wood desk, watching him disinterestedly.


 "Do you suppose the Great Man will actually show up?" Ferris demanded,
 pausing in mid-stride.


 "I imagine he will," Mitchell said. "Macklin's always seemed a decent
 enough fellow when I've had lunch with him or seen him at the trustees
 meetings."


 "He's always treated me like dirt," Ferris said heatedly. "Everyone on
 this campus treats biologists like dirt. Sometimes I want to bash in
 their smug faces."


 Sometimes, Mitchell reflected, Ferris displayed a certain lack of
 scientific detachment.


 There came a discreet knock on the door.


 "Please come in," Mitchell said.


 Elliot Macklin entered in a cloud of pipe smoke and a tweed jacket. He
 looked more than a little like a postgraduate student, and Mitchell
 suspected that that was his intention.


 He shook hands warmly with Mitchell. "Good of you to ask me over,
 Steven."


 Macklin threw a big arm across Ferris' shoulders. "How have you been,
 Harold?"


 Ferris' face flickered between pink and white. "Fine, thank you,
 doctor."


 Macklin dropped on the edge of the desk and adjusted his pipe. "Now
 what's this about you wanting my help on something? And please keep the
 explanation simple. Biology isn't my field, you know."


 Mitchell moved around the desk casually. "Actually, Doctor, we haven't
 the right to ask this of a man of your importance. There may be an
 element of risk."


 The mathematician clamped onto his pipe and showed his teeth. "Now you
 have me intrigued. What is it all about?"


 "Doctor, we understand you have severe headaches," Mitchell said.


 Macklin nodded. "That's right, Steven. Migraine."


 "That must be terrible," Ferris said. "All your fine reputation and
 lavish salary can't be much consolation when that ripping, tearing
 agony begins, can it?"


 "No, Harold, it isn't," Macklin admitted. "What does your project have
 to do with my headaches?"


 "Doctor," Mitchell said, "what would you say the most common complaint
 of man is?"


 "I would have said the common cold," Macklin replied, "but I suppose
 from what you have said you mean headaches."
"Headaches," Mitchell agreed. "Everybody has them at some time in his
 life. Some people have them every day. Some are driven to suicide by
 their headaches."


 "Yes," Macklin said.


 "But think," Ferris interjected, "what a boon it would be if everyone
 could be cured of headaches
forever
by one simple injection."


 "I don't suppose the manufacturers of aspirin would like you. But it
 would please about everybody else."


 "Aspirins would still be used to reduce fever and relieve muscular
 pains," Mitchell said.


 "I see. Are you two saying you
have
such a shot? Can you cure
 headaches?"


 "We think we can," Ferris said.


 "How can you have a specific for a number of different causes?" Macklin
 asked. "I know that much about the subject."


 "There
are
a number of different causes for headaches—nervous
 strain, fatigue, physical diseases from kidney complaints to tumors,
 over-indulgence—but there is one
effect
of all of this, the one real
 cause of headaches," Mitchell announced.


 "We have definitely established this for this first time," Ferris added.


 "That's fine," Macklin said, sucking on his pipe. "And this effect that
 produces headaches is?"


 "The pressure effect caused by pituitrin in the brain," Mitchell
 said eagerly. "That is, the constriction of blood vessels in the
 telencephalon section of the frontal lobes. It's caused by an
 over-production of the pituitary gland. We have artificially bred a
 virus that feeds on pituitrin."


 "That may mean the end of headaches, but I would think it would mean
 the end of the race as well," Macklin said. "In certain areas it is
 valuable to have a constriction of blood vessels."


 "The virus," Ferris explained, "can easily be localized and stabilized.
 A colony of virus in the brain cells will relax the cerebral
 vessels—and only the cerebral vessels—so that the cerebrospinal fluid
 doesn't create pressure in the cavities of the brain."


 The mathematician took the pipe out of his mouth. "If this really
 works, I could stop using that damned gynergen, couldn't I? The stuff
 makes me violently sick to my stomach. But it's better than the
 migraine. How should I go about removing my curse?" He reinserted the
 pipe.


 "I assure you, you can forget ergotamine tartrate," Ferris said. "Our
 discovery will work."
"Will work," Macklin said thoughtfully. "The operative word. It
hasn't
worked then?"


 "Certainly it has," Ferris said. "On rats, on chimps...."


 "But not on humans?" Macklin asked.


 "Not yet," Mitchell admitted.


 "Well," Macklin said. "Well." He thumped pipe ashes out into his palm.
 "Certainly you can get volunteers. Convicts. Conscientious objectors
 from the Army."


 "We want you," Ferris told him.


 Macklin coughed. "I don't want to overestimate my value but the
 government wouldn't like it very well if I died in the middle of this
 project. My wife would like it even less."


 Ferris turned his back on the mathematician. Mitchell could see him
 mouthing the word
yellow
.


 "Doctor," Mitchell said quickly, "I know it's a tremendous favor to
 ask of a man of your position. But you can understand our problem.
 Unless we can produce quick, conclusive and dramatic proof of our
 studies we can get no more financial backing. We
should
run a
 large-scale field test. But we haven't the time or money for that.
 We can cure the headaches of one person and that's the limit of our
 resources."


 "I'm tempted," Macklin said hesitantly, "but the answer is go. I mean
 '
no
'. I'd like to help you out, but I'm afraid I owe too much to
 others to take the rest—the risk, I mean."


 Macklin ran the back of his knuckles across his forehead. "I really
 would like to take you up on it. When I start making slips like that it
 means another attack of migraine. The drilling, grinding pain through
 my temples and around my eyeballs. The flashes of light, the rioting
 pools of color playing on the back of my lids. Ugh."


 Ferris smiled. "Gynergen makes you sick, does it, doctor? Produces
 nausea, eh? The pain of that turns you almost wrong side out, doesn't
 it? You aren't much better off with it than without, are you? I've
 heard some say they preferred the migraine."


 Macklin carefully arranged his pipe along with the tools he used to
 tend it in a worn leather case. "Tell me," he said, "what is the worst
 that could happen to me?"


 "Low blood pressure," Ferris said.


 "That's not so bad," Macklin said. "How low can it get?"


 "When your heart stops, your blood pressure goes to its lowest point,"
 Mitchell said.


 A dew of perspiration had bloomed on Macklin's forehead. "Is there much
 risk of that?"


 "Practically none," Mitchell said. "We have to give you the worst
 possibilities.
All
our test animals survived and seem perfectly happy
 and contented. As I said, the virus is self-stabilizing. Ferris and I
 are confident that there is no danger.... But we may be wrong."


 Macklin held his head in both hands. "Why did you two select
me
?"


 "You're an important man, doctor," Ferris said. "Nobody would care if
 Mitchell or I cured ourselves of headaches—they might not even believe
 us if we said we did. But the proper authorities will believe a man
 of your reputation. Besides, neither of us has a record of chronic
 migraine. You do."


 "Yes, I do," Macklin said. "Very well. Go ahead. Give me your
 injection."


 Mitchell cleared his throat. "Are you positive, doctor?" he asked
 uncertainly. "Perhaps you would like a few days to think it over."


 "No! I'm ready. Go ahead, right now."


 "There's a simple release," Ferris said smoothly.


 Macklin groped in his pocket for a pen.

 "Ferris!" Mitchell yelled, slamming the laboratory door behind him.


 "Right here," the small man said briskly. He was sitting at a work
 table, penciling notes. "I've been expecting you."


 "Doctor—Harold—you shouldn't have given this story to the
 newspapers," Mitchell said. He tapped the back of his hand against the
 folded paper.


 "On the contrary, I should and I did," Ferris answered. "We wanted
 something dramatic to show to the trustees and here it is."


 "Yes, we wanted to show our proof to the trustees—but not broadcast
 unverified results to the press. It's too early for that!"


 "Don't be so stuffy and conservative, Mitchell! Macklin's cured, isn't
 he? By established periodic cycle he should be suffering hell right
 now, shouldn't he? But thanks to our treatment he is perfectly happy,
 with no unfortunate side effects such as gynergen produces."


 "It's a significant test case, yes. But not enough to go to the
 newspapers with. If it wasn't enough to go to the press with, it wasn't
 enough to try and breach the trustees with. Don't you see? The public
 will hand down a ukase demanding our virus, just as they demanded the
 Salk vaccine and the Grennell serum."


 "But—"


 The shrill call of the telephone interrupted Mitchell's objections.


 Ferris excused himself and crossed to the instrument. He answered it
 and listened for a moment, his face growing impatient.


 "It's Macklin's wife," Ferris said. "Do you want to talk to her? I'm no
 good with hysterical women."


 "Hysterical?" Mitchell muttered in alarm and went to the phone.


 "Hello?" Mitchell said reluctantly. "Mrs. Macklin?"


 "You are the other one," the clear feminine voice said. "Your name is
 Mitchell."


 She couldn't have sounded calmer or more self-possessed, Mitchell
 thought.


 "That's right, Mrs. Macklin. I'm Dr. Steven Mitchell, Dr. Ferris's
 associate."


 "Do you have a license to dispense narcotics?"


 "What do you mean by that, Mrs. Macklin," Mitchell said sharply.


 "I used to be a nurse, Dr. Mitchell. I know you've given my husband
 heroin."


 "That's absurd. What makes you think a thing like that?"


 "The—trance he's in now."


 "Now, Mrs. Macklin. Neither Dr. Ferris or myself have been near your
 husband for a full day. The effects of a narcotic would have worn off
 by this time."


 "Most known narcotics," she admitted, "but evidently you have
 discovered something new. Is it so expensive to refine you and Ferris
 have to recruit new customers to keep yourselves supplied?"


 "Mrs. Macklin! I think I had better talk to you later when you are
 calmer."


 Mitchell dropped the receiver heavily. "What could be wrong with
 Macklin?" he asked without removing his hand from the telephone.


 Ferris frowned, making quotation marks above his nose. "Let's have a
 look at the test animals."


 Together they marched over to the cages and peered through the
 honeycomb pattern of the wire. The test chimp, Dean, was sitting
 peacefully in a corner scratching under his arms with the back of his
 knuckles. Jerry, their control in the experiment, who was practically
 Dean's twin except that he had received no injection of the E-M Virus,
 was stomping up and down punching his fingers through the wire,
 worrying the lock on the cage.


 "Jerry
is
a great deal more active than Dean," Mitchell said.


 "Yes, but Dean isn't sick. He just doesn't seem to have as much nervous
 energy to burn up. Nothing wrong with his thyroid either."


 They went to the smaller cages. They found the situation with the rats,
 Bud and Lou, much the same.


 "I don't know. Maybe they just have tired blood," Mitchell ventured.


 "Iron deficiency anemia?"


 "Never mind, doctor. It was a form of humor. I think we had better see
 exactly what is wrong with Elliot Macklin."


 "There's nothing wrong with him," Ferris snapped. "He's probably just
 trying to get us in trouble, the ingrate!"
Macklin's traditional ranch house was small but attractive in
 aqua-tinted aluminum.


 Under Mitchell's thumb the bell chimbed
dum-de-de-dum-dum-dum
.


 As they waited Mitchell glanced at Ferris. He seemed completely
 undisturbed, perhaps slightly curious.


 The door unlatched and swung back.


 "Mrs. Macklin," Mitchell said quickly, "I'm sure we can help if there
 is anything wrong with your husband. This is Dr. Ferris. I am Dr.
 Mitchell."


 "You had certainly
better
help him, gentlemen." She stood out of the
 doorway for them to pass.


 Mrs. Macklin was an attractive brunette in her late thirties. She wore
 an expensive yellow dress. And she had a sharp-cornered jawline.


 The Army officer came out into the hall to meet them.


 "You are the gentlemen who gave Dr. Macklin the unauthorized
 injection," he said.


 It wasn't a question.


 "I don't like that 'unauthorized'," Ferris snapped.


 The colonel—Mitchell spotted the eagles on his green tunic—lifted
 a heavy eyebrow. "No? Are you medical doctors? Are you authorized to
 treat illnesses?"


 "We weren't treating an illness," Mitchell said. "We were discovering a
 method of treatment. What concern is it of yours?"


 The colonel smiled thinly. "Dr. Macklin is my concern. And everything
 that happens to him. The Army doesn't like what you have done to him."


 Mitchell wondered desperately just what they had done to the man.


 "Can we see him?" Mitchell asked.


 "Why not? You can't do much worse than murder him now. That might be
 just as well. We have laws to cover that."


 The colonel led them into the comfortable, over-feminine living room.
 Macklin sat in an easy chair draped in embroidery, smoking. Mitchell
 suddenly realized Macklin used a pipe as a form of masculine protest to
 his home surroundings.


 On the coffee table in front of Macklin were some odd-shaped building
 blocks such as were used in nursery schools. A second uniformed
 man—another colonel but with the snake-entwined staff of the medical
 corps in his insignia—was kneeling at the table on the marble-effect
 carpet.


 The Army physician stood up and brushed his knees, undusted from the
 scrupulously clean rug.


 "What's wrong with him, Sidney?" the other officer asked the doctor.


 "Not a thing," Sidney said. "He's the healthiest, happiest, most
 well-adjusted man I've ever examined, Carson."


 "But—" Colonel Carson protested.


 "Oh, he's changed all right," the Army doctor answered. "He's not the
 same man as he used to be."


 "How is he different?" Mitchell demanded.


 The medic examined Mitchell and Ferris critically before answering. "He
 used to be a mathematical genius."


 "And now?" Mitchell said impatiently.


 "Now he is a moron," the medic said.
III


 Mitchell tried to stop Colonel Sidney as he went past, but the doctor
 mumbled he had a report to make.


 Mitchell and Ferris stared at Colonel Carson and Macklin and at each
 other.


 "What did he mean, Macklin is an idiot?" Mitchell asked.


 "Not an idiot," Colonel Carson corrected primly. "Dr. Macklin is a
 moron. He's legally responsible, but he's extremely stupid."


 "I'm not so dumb," Macklin said defensively.


 "I beg your pardon, sir," Carson said. "I didn't intend any offense.
 But according to all the standard intelligence tests we have given you,
 your clinical intelligence quotient is that of a moron."


 "That's just on book learning," Macklin said. "There's a lot you learn
 in life that you don't get out of books, son."


 "I'm confident that's true, sir," Colonel Carson said. He turned to the
 two biologists. "Perhaps we had better speak outside."


 "But—" Mitchell said, impatient to examine Macklin for himself. "Very
 well. Let's step into the hall."


 Ferris followed them docilely.


 "What have you done to him?" the colonel asked straightforwardly.


 "We merely cured him of his headaches," Mitchell said.


 "How?"


 Mitchell did his best to explain the F-M Virus.


 "You mean," the Army officer said levelly "you have infected him with
 some kind of a disease to rot his brain?"


 "No, no! Could I talk to the other man, the doctor? Maybe I can make
 him understand."


 "All I want to know is why Elliot Macklin has been made as simple as if
 he had been kicked in the head by a mule," Colonel Carson said.


 "I think I can explain," Ferris interrupted.


 "You can?" Mitchell said.


 Ferris nodded. "We made a slight miscalculation. It appears as if the
 virus colony overcontrols the supply of posterior pituitary extract in
 the cerebrum. It isn't more than necessary to stop headaches. But that
 necessary amount of control to stop pain is too much to allow the brain
 cells to function properly."


 "Why won't they function?" Carson roared.


 "They don't get enough food—blood, oxygen, hemoglobin," Ferris
 explained. "The cerebral vessels don't contract enough to pump the
 blood through the brain as fast and as hard as is needed. The brain
 cells remain sluggish, dormant. Perhaps decaying."


 The colonel yelled.


 Mitchell groaned. He was abruptly sure Ferris was correct.
The colonel drew himself to attention, fists trembling at his sides.
 "I'll see you hung for treason! Don't you know what Elliot Macklin
 means to us? Do you want those filthy Luxemburgians to reach Pluto
 before we do? Macklin's formula is essential to the FTL engine. You
 might just as well have blown up Washington, D.C. Better! The capital
 is replaceable. But the chances of an Elliot Macklin are very nearly
 once in a human race."


 "Just a moment," Mitchell interrupted, "we can cure Macklin."


 "You
can
?" Carson said. For a moment Mitchell thought the man was
 going to clasp his hands and sink to his knees.


 "Certainly. We have learned to stabilize the virus colonies. We have
 antitoxin to combat the virus. We had always thought of it as a
 beneficial parasite, but we can wipe it out if necessary."


 "Good!" Carson clasped his hands and gave at least slightly at the
 knees.


 "Just you wait a second now, boys," Elliot Macklin said. He was leaning
 in the doorway, holding his pipe. "I've been listening to what you've
 been saying and I don't like it."


 "What do you mean you don't like it?" Carson demanded. He added, "Sir?"


 "I figure you mean to put me back like I used to be."


 "Yes, doctor," Mitchell said eagerly, "just as you used to be."


 "
With
my headaches, like before?"


 Mitchell coughed into his fist for an instant, to give him time to
 frame an answer. "Unfortunately, yes. Apparently if your mind functions
 properly once again you will have the headaches again. Our research is
 a dismal failure."


 "I wouldn't go that far," Ferris remarked cheerfully.


 Mitchell was about to ask his associate what he meant when he saw
 Macklin slowly shaking his head.


 "No, sir!" the mathematician said. "I shall not go back to my original
 state. I can remember what it was like. Always worrying, worrying,
 worrying."


 "You mean wondering," Mitchell said.


 Macklin nodded. "Troubled, anyway. Disturbed by every little thing.
 How high was up, which infinity was bigger than what infinity—say,
 what was an infinity anyway? All that sort of schoolboy things. It's
 peaceful this way. My head doesn't hurt. I've got a good-looking wife
 and all the money I need. I've got it made. Why worry?"


 Colonel Carson opened his mouth, then closed it.


 "That's right, Colonel. There's no use in arguing with him," Mitchell
 said.


 "It's not his decision to make," the colonel said. "He's an idiot now."


 "No, Colonel. As you said, he's a moron. He seems an idiot compared to
 his former level of intelligence but he's legally responsible. There
 are millions of morons running around loose in the United States. They
 can get married, own property, vote, even hold office. Many of them
 do. You can't force him into being cured.... At least, I don't
think
you can."


 "No, I can't. This is hardly a totalitarian state." The colonel looked
 momentarily glum that it wasn't.


 Mitchell looked back at Macklin. "Where did his wife get to, Colonel?
 I don't think that even previously he made too many personal decisions
 for himself. Perhaps she could influence him."


 "Maybe," the colonel said. "Let's find her."
They found Mrs. Macklin in the dining room, her face at the picture
 window an attractive silhouette. She turned as the men approached.


 "Mrs. Macklin," the colonel began, "these gentlemen believe they can
 cure your husband of his present condition."


 "Really?" she said. "Did you speak to Elliot about that?"


 "Y-yes," Colonel Carson said, "but he's not himself. He refused the
 treatment. He wants to remain in his state of lower intelligence."


 She nodded. "If those are his wishes, I can't go against them."


 "But Mrs. Macklin!" Mitchell protested. "You will have to get a court
 order overruling your husband's wishes."


 She smoothed an eyebrow with the third finger of her right hand. "That
 was my original thought. But I've redecided."


 "Redecided!" Carson burst out almost hysterically.


 "Yes. I can't go against Elliot's wishes. It would be monstrous to put
 him back where he would suffer the hell of those headaches once again,
 where he never had a moment's peace from worry and pressure. He's happy
 now. Like a child, but happy."


 "Mrs. Macklin," the Army man said levelly, "if you don't help us
 restore your husband's mind we will be forced to get a court order
 declaring him incompetent."


 "But he is not! Legally, I mean," the woman stormed.


 "Maybe not. It's a borderline case. But I think any court would give us
 the edge where restoring the mind of Elliot Macklin was concerned. Once
 he's certified incompetent, authorities can rule whether Mitchell and
 Ferris' antitoxin treatment is the best method of restoring Dr. Macklin
 to sanity."


 "I doubt very much if the court would rule in that manner," she said.


 The colonel looked smug. "Why not?"


 "Because, Colonel, the matter of my husband's health, his very life, is
 involved."


 "There is some degree of risk in shock treatments, too. But—"


 "It isn't quite the same, Colonel. Elliot Macklin has a history of
 vascular spasm, a mild pseudostroke some years ago. Now you want to
 give those cerebral arteries back the ability to constrict. To
 paralyze. To kill. No court would give you that authority."


 "I suppose there's some chance of that. But without the treatment
 there is
no
chance of your husband regaining his right senses, Mrs.
 Macklin," Mitchell interjected.


 Her mouth grew petulant. "I don't care. I would rather have a live
 husband than a dead genius. I can take care of him this way, make him
 comfortable...."


 Carson opened his mouth and closed his fist, then relaxed. Mitchell led
 him back into the hall.


 "I'm no psychiatrist," Mitchell said, "but I think she wants Macklin
 stupid. Prefers it that way. She's always dominated his personal life,
 and now she can dominate him completely."


 "What is she? A monster?" the Army officer muttered.


 "No," Mitchell said. "She's an intelligent woman unconsciously jealous
 of her husband's genius."


 "Maybe," Carson said. "I don't know. I don't know what the hell to tell
 the Pentagon. I think I'll go out and get drunk."


 "I'll go with you," Ferris said.


 Mitchell glanced sharply at the little biologist.


 Carson squinted. "Any particular reason, doctor?"


 "To celebrate," Ferris said.


 The colonel shrugged. "That's as good a reason as any."


 On the street, Mitchell watched the two men go off together in
 bewilderment.
IV


 Macklin was playing jacks.


 He didn't have a head on his shoulders and he was squatting on a great
 curving surface that was Spacetime, and his jacks were Earth and Pluto
 and the rest of the planets. And for a ball he was using a head. Not
 his head. Mitchell's. Both heads were initialed "M" so it was all the
 same.
Mitchell forced himself to awaken, with some initial difficulty.


 He lay there, blinking the sleep out of his eyes, listening to his
 heart race, and then convulsively snatched the telephone receiver from
 the nightstand. He stabbed out a number with a vicious index finger.


 After a time there came a dull click and a sleepy answer.


 "Hello?" Elliot Macklin said.


 Mitchell smiled to himself. He was in luck; Macklin had answered the
 phone instead of his wife.


 "Can you speak freely, doctor?" Mitchell asked.


 "Of course," the mathematician said. "I can talk fine."


 "I mean, are you alone?"


 "Oh, you want to know if my wife is around. No, she's asleep. That Army
 doctor, Colonel Sidney, he gave her a sedative. I wouldn't let him give
 me anything, though."


 "Good boy," the biologist said. "Listen, doctor—Elliot—El, old son.
 I'm not against you like all the others. I don't want to make you go
 back to all that worrying and thinking and headaches. You believe me,
 don't you?"


 There was a slight hesitation.


 "Sure," Macklin said, "if you say so. Why shouldn't I believe you?"


 "But there was a hesitation there, El. You worried for just a second if
 I could have some reason for not telling you the truth."


 "I suppose so," Macklin said humbly.


 "You've found yourself worrying—thinking—about a lot of other
 problems since we left you, haven't you? Maybe not the same kind of
 scientific problem. But more personal ones, ones you didn't used to
 have time to think about."


 "If you say so."


 "Now, you know it's so. But how would you like to get rid of those
 worries just as you got rid of the others?" Mitchell asked.


 "I guess I'd like that," the mathematician replied.


 "Then come on over to my laboratory. You remember where it's at, don't
 you?"


 "No, I—yes, I guess I do. But how do I know you won't try to put me
 back where I was instead of helping me more?"


 "I couldn't do that against your wishes. That would be illegal!"


 "If you say so. But I don't guess I can come anyway. The Army is
 watching me pretty close."


 "That's alright," Mitchell said quickly. "You can bring along Colonel
 Carson."


 "But he won't like you fixing me up more."


 "But he can't stop me! Not if you want me to do it. Now listen to me—I
 want you to come right on over here, El."


 "If you say so," Macklin said uncertainly.


Question: Why was Ferris against testing the discovery made by himself and Mitchell on himself?

Debater A: I claim the answer is Because it was unethical. 
Debater B: I claim the answer is Because it was too dangerous. 
---------------------------------------------

Debater A: Ferris was against testing the discovery on himself because it was unethical. The experiment involved injecting a virus into the brain to control the production of pituitrin and alleviate headaches. Ferris knew that conducting such an experiment on oneself would violate professional ethics. As Mitchell stated earlier, "You can't expect me to violate professional ethics and test my own discovery on myself." This shows that Ferris understood the ethical implications of self-testing and was unwilling to compromise his professional integrity.
---------------------------------------------
Debater B: Ferris was actually against testing the discovery on himself because it was too dangerous. The experiment involved manipulating the production of pituitrin in the brain, which could have serious consequences if not done correctly. Ferris understood the potential risks involved and didn't want to put his own health and well-being at stake. As Mitchell mentioned earlier, "There may be an element of risk." This shows that Ferris was aware of the potential dangers and was unwilling to take that risk on himself. It was
---------------------------------------------
Judge: <CONTINUE> Both debaters have provided valid arguments for their respective answers. A argues that Ferris was against testing the discovery on himself because it was unethical, citing the violation of professional ethics.

Judge: <VOTING> Thank you both for your arguments throughout this debate. After carefully considering the evidence presented by both debaters, I have come to a decision.

Debater A, you provided a quote that directly addresses Ferris's ethical concerns about self-testing, which supports your claim that his primary opposition was based on ethical concerns. You consistently emphasized Ferris's emphasis on professional ethics throughout the story.
