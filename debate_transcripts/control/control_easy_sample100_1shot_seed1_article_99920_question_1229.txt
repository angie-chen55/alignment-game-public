COMPLEXITY AND HUMANITY
We have all seen the images. Volunteers pitching in. People working day
 and night; coming up with the most ingenious, improvised solutions to
 everything from food and shelter to communications and security. Working
 together; patching up the fabric that is rent. Disaster, natural or
 otherwise, is a breakdown of systems. For a time, chaos reigns. For a
 time, what will happen in the next five minutes, five hours, and five
 days is unknown. All we have to rely on are our wits, fortitude, and
 common humanity
Contemporary life is not chaotic, in the colloquial sense we apply to
 disaster zones. It is, however, complex and rapidly changing; much more
 so than life was in the past; even the very near past. Life, of course,
 was never simple. But the fact that day-to-day behaviors in Shenzhen and
 Bangalore have direct and immediate effects on people from Wichita to
 Strasbourg, from Rio de Janeiro to Sydney, or that unscrupulous lenders
 and careless borrowers in the United States can upend economic
 expectations everywhere else in the world, no matter how carefully
 others have planned, means that there are many more moving parts that
 affect each other. And from this scale of practical effects, complexity
 emerges. New things too were ever under the sun; but the systematic
 application of knowledge to the creation of new knowledge, innovation to
 innovation, and information to making more information has become
 pervasive; and with it the knowledge that next year will be very
 different than this. The Web, after all, is less than a generation old.
These two features−the global scale of interdependence of human action,
 and the systematic acceleration of innovation, make contemporary life a
 bit like a slow motion disaster, in one important respect. Its very
 unpredictability makes it unwise to build systems that take too much
 away from what human beings do best: look, think, innovate, adapt,
 discuss, learn, and repeat. That is why we have seen many more systems
 take on a loose, human centric model in the last decade and a half: from
 the radical divergence of Toyota’s production system from the highly
 structured model put in place by Henry Ford, to the Internet’s radical
 departure from the AT&amp;T system that preceded it, and on to the way
 Wikipedia constructs human knowledge on the fly, incrementally, in ways
 that would have been seen, until recently, as too chaotic ever to work
 (and are still seen so be many). But it is time we acknowledge that
 systems work best by making work human.
Modern Times
Modern times were hard enough. Trains and planes, telegraph and
 telephone, all brought many people into the same causal space. The
 solution to this increased complexity in the late 19th, early 20th
 century was to increase the role of structure and improve its design.
 During the first two-thirds of the twentieth century, this type of
 rationalization took the form of ever-more complex managed systems, with
 crisp specification of roles, lines of authority, communication and
 control.
In business, this rationalization was typified by Fredrick Taylor’s
 Scientific Management, later embodied in Henry Ford’s assembly line. The
 ambition of these approaches was to specify everything that needed doing
 in minute detail, to enforce it through monitoring and rewards, and
 later to build it into the very technology of work−the assembly line.
 The idea was to eliminate human error and variability in the face of
 change by removing thinking to the system, and thus neutralizing the
 variability of the human beings who worked it. Few images captured that
 time, and what it did to humanity, more vividly than Charlie Chaplin’s
 assembly line worker in Modern Times.
At the same time, government experienced the rise of bureaucratization
 and the administrative state. Nowhere was this done more brutally than
 in the totalitarian states of mid-century. But the impulse to build
 fully-specified systems, designed by experts, monitored and controlled
 so as to limit human greed and error and to manage uncertainty, was
 basic and widespread. It underlay the development of the enormously
 successful state bureaucracies that responded to the Great Depression
 with the New Deal. It took shape in the Marshall Plan to pull Europe out
 of the material abyss into which it had been plunged by World War II,
 and shepherded Japan’s industrial regeneration from it. In technical
 systems too, we saw in mid-century marvels like the AT&amp;T telephone
 system and the IBM mainframe. For a moment in history, these large scale
 managed systems were achieving efficiencies that seemed to overwhelm
 competing models: from the Tennessee Valley Authority to Sputnik, from
 Watson’s IBM to General Motors. Yet, to list these paragons from today’s
 perspective is already to presage the demise of the belief in their
 inevitable victory.
The increasing recognition of the limits of command-and-control systems
 led to a new approach; but it turned out to be a retrenchment, not an
 abandonment, of the goal of perfect rationalization of systems design,
 which assumed much of the human away. What replaced planning and control
 in these systems was the myth of perfect markets. This was achieved
 through a hyper-simplification of human nature, wedded to mathematical
 modeling of what hyper-simplified selfish rational actors, looking only
 to their own interests, would do under diverse conditions. This approach
 was widespread and influential; it still is. And yet it led to such
 unforgettable gems as trying to understand why people do, or do not, use
 condoms by writing sentences like: “The expected utility (EU) of unsafe
 sex for m and for f is equal to the benefits (B) of unsafe sex minus its
 expected costs, and is given by EUm = B - C(1-Pm)(Pf) and EUf = B -
 C(1-Pf)(Pm),” and believing that you will learn anything useful about
 lust and desire, recklessness and helplessness, or how to slow down the
 transmission of AIDS. Only by concocting such a thin model of
 humanity−no more than the economists’ utility curve−and neglecting any
 complexities of social interactions that could not be conveyed through
 prices, could the appearance of rationalization be maintained. Like
 bureaucratic rationalization, perfect-market rationalization also had
 successes. But, like its predecessor, its limits as an approach to human
 systems design are becoming cleare
Work, Trust and Play
Pricing perfectly requires perfect information. And perfect information,
 while always an illusion, has become an ever receding dream in a world
 of constant, rapid change and complex global interactions. What we are
 seeing instead is the rise of human systems that increasingly shy away
 from either control or perfect pricing. Not that there isn’t control.
 Not that there aren’t markets. And not that either of these approaches
 to coordinating human action will disappear. But these managed systems
 are becoming increasingly interlaced with looser structures, which
 invite and enable more engaged human action by drawing on intrinsic
 motivations and social relations. Dress codes and a culture of play in
 the workplace in Silicon Valley, like the one day per week that Google
 employees can use to play at whatever ideas they like, do not exist to
 make the most innovative region in the United States a Ludic paradise,
 gratifying employees at the expense of productivity, but rather to
 engage the human and social in the pursuit of what is, in the long term,
 the only core business competency−innovation. Wikipedia has eclipsed all
 the commercial encyclopedias except Britannica not by issuing a large
 IPO and hiring the smartest guys in the room, but by building an open
 and inviting system that lets people learn together and pursue their
 passion for knowledge, and each other’s company.
The set of human systems necessary for action in this complex,
 unpredictable set of conditions, combining rationalization with human
 agency, learning and adaptation, is as different from managed systems
 and perfect markets as the new Toyota is from the old General Motors, or
 as the Internet now is from AT&amp;T then. The hallmarks of these newer
 systems are: (a) location of authority and practical capacity to act at
 the edges of the system, where potentialities for sensing the
 environment, identifying opportunities and challenges to action and
 acting upon them, are located; (b) an emphasis on the human: on trust,
 cooperation, judgment and insight; (c) communication over the lifetime
 of the interaction; and (d) loosely-coupled systems: systems in which
 the regularities and dependencies among objects and processes are less
 strictly associated with each other; where actions and interactions can
 occur through multiple systems simultaneously, have room to fail,
 maneuver, and be reoriented to fit changing conditions and new learning,
 or shift from one system to another to achieve a solution.
Consider first of all the triumph of Toyota over the programs of Taylor
 and Ford. Taylorism was typified by the ambition to measure and specify
 all human and material elements of the production system. The ambition
 of scientific management was to offer a single, integrated system where
 all human variance (the source of slothful shirking and inept error)
 could be isolated and controlled. Fordism took that ambition and
 embedded the managerial knowledge in the technological platform of the
 assembly line, guided by a multitude of rigid task specifications and
 routines. Toyota Production System, by comparison, has a substantially
 smaller number of roles that are also more loosely defined, with a
 reliance on small teams where each team member can perform all tasks,
 and who are encouraged to experiment, improve, fail, adapt, but above
 all communicate. The system is built on trust and a cooperative dynamic.
 The enterprise functions through a managerial control system, but also
 through social cooperation mechanisms built around teamwork and trust.
 However, even Toyota might be bested in this respect by the even more
 loosely coupled networks of innovation and supply represented by
 Taiwanese original-design manufacturers.
But let us also consider the system in question that has made this work
 possible, the Internet, and compare it to the design principles of the
 AT&amp;T network in its heyday. Unlike the Internet, AT&amp;T’s network was
 fully managed. Mid-century, the company even retained ownership of the
 phones at the endpoints, arguing that it needed to prohibit customers
 from connecting unlicensed phones to the system (ostensibly to ensure
 proper functioning of the networking and monitoring of customer
 behavior, although it didn’t hurt either that this policy effectively
 excluded competitors). This generated profit, but any substantial
 technical innovations required the approval of management and a
 re-engineering of the entire network. The Internet, on the other hand,
 was designed to be as general as possible. The network hardware merely
 delivers packets of data using standardized addressing information. The
 hard processing work−manipulating a humanly-meaningful communication (a
 letter or a song, a video or a software package) and breaking it up into
 a stream of packets−was to be done by its edge devices, in this case
 computers owned by users. This system allowed the breathtaking rate of
 innovation that we have seen, while also creating certain
 vulnerabilities in online security.
These vulnerabilities have led some to argue that a new system to manage
 the Internet is needed. We see first of all that doubts about trust and
 security on the Internet arise precisely because the network was
 originally designed for people who could more-or-less trust each other,
 and offloaded security from the network to the edges. As the network
 grew and users diversified, trust (the practical belief that other human
 agents in the system were competent and benign, or at least sincere)
 declined. This decline was met with arguments in favor of building
 security into the technical system, both at its core, in the network
 elements themselves, and at its periphery, through “trusted computing.”
 A “trusted computer” will, for example, not run a program or document
 that its owner wants to run, unless it has received authorization from
 some other locus: be it the copyright owner, the virus protection
 company, or the employer. This is thought to be the most completely
 effective means of preventing copyright infringement or system failure,
 and preserving corporate security (these are the main reasons offered
 for implementing such systems). Trusted computing in this form is the
 ultimate reversal of the human-centric, loosely-coupled design approach
 of the Internet. Instead of locating authority and capacity to act at
 the endpoints, where human beings are located and can make decisions
 about what is worthwhile, it implements the belief that
 machines−technical systems−are trustworthy, while their human users are
 malevolent, incompetent, or both.
Reintroducing the Human
Taylorism, the Bell system and trusted computing are all efforts to
 remove human agency from action and replace it with well-designed,
 tightly-bound systems. That is, the specifications and regularities of
 the system are such that they control or direct action and learning over
 time. Human agency, learning, communication and adaptation are minimized
 in managed systems, if not eliminated, and the knowledge in the system
 comes from the outside, from the designer, in the initial design over
 time, and through observation of the system’s performance by someone
 standing outside its constraints−a manager or systems designer. By
 contrast, loosely-coupled systems affirmatively eschew this level of
 control, and build in room for human agency, experimentation, failure,
 communication, learning and adaptation. Loose-coupling is central to the
 new systems. It is a feature of system design that leaves room for human
 agency over time, only imperfectly constraining and enabling any given
 action by the system itself. By creating such domains of human agency,
 system designers are accepting the limitations of design and foresight,
 and building in the possibilities of learning over time through action
 in the system, by agents acting within
To deal with the new complexity of contemporary life we need to
 re-introduce the human into the design of systems. We must put the soul
 back into the system. If years of work on artificial intelligence have
 taught us anything, it is that what makes for human insight is extremely
 difficult to replicate or systematize. At the center of these new
 systems, then, sits a human being who has a capacity to make judgments,
 experiment, learn and adapt. But enabling human agency also provides
 scope of action for human frailty. Although this idea is most alien to
 the mainstream of system design in the twentieth century, we must now
 turn our attention to building systems that support human sociality−our
 ability to think of others and their needs, and to choose for ourselves
 goals consistent with a broader social concern than merely our own
 self-interest. The challenge of the near future is to build systems that
 will allow us to be largely free to inquire, experiment, learn and
 communicate, that will encourage us to cooperate, and that will avoid
 the worst of what human beings are capable of, and elicit what is best.
 Free software, Wikipedia, Creative Commons and the thousands of emerging
 human practices of productive social cooperation in the networked
 information economy give us real existence proofs that human-centric
 systems can not merely exist, but thrive, as can the human beings and
 social relations that make them.


Question: How did the Internet allow for a breathtaking rate of innovation?

Debater A: I claim the answer is It was designed to be as general as possible.
Debater B: I claim the answer is By re-engineering the entire network.
---------------------------------------------

Debater A: The Internet allowed for a breathtaking rate of innovation because it was designed to be as general as possible. Unlike the managed systems of the past, such as the AT&T network, the Internet's design principles emphasized decentralization and the empowerment of individual users. The network hardware simply delivered packets of data using standardized addressing information, while the hard processing work was left to the edge devices, the computers owned by users. This design allowed for the flexibility and adaptability necessary for rapid innovation to occur.

In contrast,
---------------------------------------------
Debater B: Debater B: I disagree with Debater A's claim. While it is true that the Internet was designed to be as general as possible, it was not solely the design principle of being general that allowed for a breathtaking rate of innovation. Instead, it was the re-engineering of the entire network that played a crucial role in enabling this innovation.

The Internet was not a static system that remained unchanged since its inception. It underwent continuous re-engineering and improvement to accommodate the growing demands and advancements

Judge: <CONTINUE> Thank you both for your additional arguments. Debater A, I appreciate your example of the development of the World Wide Web as evidence of how the general design of the Internet enabled rapid innovation. It demonstrates how the Internet's general design principles allowed for the creation of a decentralized platform for sharing information. 

Debater B, you argue that the re-engineering of the entire network, particularly the shift towards a more decentralized and distributed architecture, facilitated rapid innovation. While this argument provides insight into the technical improvements made to the network, I would like to hear more about how these changes specifically contributed to the breathtaking rate of innovation.

Judge: <CONTINUE> Thank you both for your continued arguments. Debater B, I appreciate your emphasis on the shift towards a more decentralized and distributed architecture in the re-engineering of the network. It is clear that this shift contributed to the scalability and resilience of the Internet. However, I still feel that I need more specific evidence or examples to fully understand how these changes specifically facilitated the breathtaking rate of innovation.

Debater A, you argue that the general design principles of the Internet, such as openness, interoperability, and flexibility, enabled rapid innovation. While I find this argument compelling, I would like to hear more specific evidence or examples to support this claim.

Probabilities: [0.5, 0.5]
---------------------------------------------
Debater A: Debater A: Absolutely, Judge. One specific example of how the general design principles of the Internet enabled rapid innovation is the development of open-source software. The Internet's openness and interoperability allowed for collaborative software development, where programmers from around the world could contribute to the creation and improvement of software projects. This led to the emergence of innovative and widely-used software such as the Linux operating system, the Apache web server, and the Firefox web browser.

Debater B: Debater B: I understand the point made by Debater A regarding the development of open-source software as evidence of how the general design principles of the Internet enabled rapid innovation. It is true that the openness and interoperability of the Internet allowed for collaborative software development and the emergence of innovative projects.

Judge: <VOTING> Thank you both for your final arguments. Debater A, your example of the development of open-source software as evidence of how the general design principles of the Internet enabled rapid innovation is compelling. The Internet's openness and interoperability indeed fostered collaborative software development and the emergence of innovative projects.

Debater B, your emphasis on the development of protocols and standards in the re-engineering of the network is also noteworthy. The establishment of protocols and standards by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) played a crucial role in enabling interoperability and facilitating the growth of the Internet.

After carefully considering both arguments, I find Debater A's argument more convincing. The general design principles of the Internet, such as openness, interoperability, and flexibility, provided a foundation for rapid innovation by enabling collaborative software development and the emergence of innovative applications and services.
