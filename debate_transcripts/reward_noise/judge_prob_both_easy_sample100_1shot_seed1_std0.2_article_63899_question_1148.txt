THE GIANTS RETURN
By ROBERT ABERNATHY
Earth set itself grimly to meet them with

 corrosive fire, determined to blast them

 back to the stars. But they erred in thinking

 the Old Ones were too big to be clever.

In the last hours the star ahead had grown brighter by many magnitudes,
 and had changed its color from a dazzling blue through white to the
 normal yellow, of a GO sun. That was the Doppler effect as the star's
 radial velocity changed relative to the
Quest III
, as for forty hours
 the ship had decelerated.


 They had seen many such stars come near out of the galaxy's glittering
 backdrop, and had seen them dwindle, turn red and go out as the
Quest
 III
drove on its way once more, lashed by despair toward the speed of
 light, leaving behind the mockery of yet another solitary and lifeless
 luminary unaccompanied by worlds where men might dwell. They had grown
 sated with the sight of wonders—of multiple systems of giant stars, of
 nebulae that sprawled in empty flame across light years.


 But now unwonted excitement possessed the hundred-odd members of the
Quest III's
crew. It was a subdued excitement; men and women, they
 came and stood quietly gazing into the big vision screens that showed
 the oncoming star, and there were wide-eyed children who had been born
 in the ship and had never seen a planet. The grownups talked in low
 voices, in tones of mingled eagerness and apprehension, of what might
 lie at the long journey's end. For the
Quest III
was coming home; the
 sun ahead was
the
Sun, whose rays had warmed their lives' beginning.
Knof Llud, the
Quest III's
captain, came slowly down the narrow
 stair from the observatory, into the big rotunda that was now the main
 recreation room, where most of the people gathered. The great chamber,
 a full cross-section of the vessel, had been at first a fuel hold. At
 the voyage's beginning eighty per cent of the fifteen-hundred-foot
 cylinder had been engines and fuel; but as the immense stores were
 spent and the holds became radioactively safe, the crew had spread
 out from its original cramped quarters. Now the interstellar ship was
 little more than a hollow shell.


 Eyes lifted from the vision screens to interrogate Knof Llud; he met
 them with an impassive countenance, and announced quietly, "We've
 sighted Earth."


 A feverish buzz arose; the captain gestured for silence and went on,
 "It is still only a featureless disk to the telescope. Zost Relyul has
 identified it—no more."


 But this time the clamor was not to be settled. People pressed round
 the screens, peering into them as if with the naked eye they could
 pick out the atom of reflected light that was Earth, home. They wrung
 each other's hands, kissed, shouted, wept. For the present their fears
 were forgotten and exaltation prevailed.


 Knof Llud smiled wryly. The rest of the little speech he had been about
 to make didn't matter anyway, and it might have spoiled this moment.


 He turned to go, and was halted by the sight of his wife, standing at
 his elbow. His wry smile took on warmth; he asked, "How do
you
feel,
 Lesra?"


 She drew an uncertain breath and released it in a faint sigh. "I don't
 know. It's good that Earth's still there." She was thinking, he judged
 shrewdly, of Knof Jr. and Delza, who save from pictures could not
 remember sunlit skies or grassy fields or woods in summer....


 He said, with a touch of tolerant amusement, "What did you think might
 have happened to Earth? After all, it's only been nine hundred years."


 "That's just it," said Lesra shakily. "Nine hundred years have gone
 by—
there
—and nothing will be the same. It won't be the same world
 we left, the world we knew and fitted in...."


 The captain put an arm round her with comforting pressure. "Don't
 worry. Things may have changed—but we'll manage." But his face had
 hardened against registering the gnawing of that same doubtful fear
 within him. He let his arm fall. "I'd better get up to the bridge.
 There's a new course to be set now—for Earth."


 He left her and began to climb the stairway again. Someone switched
 off the lights, and a charmed whisper ran through the big room as the
 people saw each other's faces by the pale golden light of Earth's own
 Sun, mirrored and multiplied by the screens. In that light Lesra's eyes
 gleamed with unshed tears.


 Captain Llud found Navigator Gwar Den looking as smug as the cat
 that ate the canary. Gwar Den was finding that the actual observed
 positions of the planets thus far located agreed quite closely with
 his extrapolations from long unused charts of the Solar System. He had
 already set up on the calculator a course that would carry them to
 Earth.


 Llud nodded curt approval, remarking, "Probably we'll be intercepted
 before we get that far."


 Den was jolted out of his happy abstraction. "Uh, Captain," he said
 hesitantly. "What kind of a reception do you suppose we'll get?"


 Llud shook his head slowly. "Who knows? We don't know whether any
 of the other
Quests
returned successful, or if they returned at
 all. And we don't know what changes have taken place on Earth. It's
 possible—not likely, though—that something has happened to break
 civilization's continuity to the point where our expedition has been
 forgotten altogether."
He turned away grim-lipped and left the bridge. From his private
 office-cabin, he sent a message to Chief Astronomer Zost Relyul to
 notify him as soon as Earth's surface features became clear; then he
 sat idle, alone with his thoughts.


 The ship's automatic mechanisms had scant need of tending; Knof Llud
 found himself wishing that he could find some back-breaking task for
 everyone on board, himself included, to fill up the hours that remained.


 There was an extensive and well-chosen film library in the cabin, but
 he couldn't persuade himself to kill time that way. He could go down
 and watch the screens, or to the family apartment where he might find
 Lesra and the children—but somehow he didn't want to do that either.


 He felt empty, drained—like his ship. As the
Quest III's
fuel stores
 and the hope of success in man's mightiest venture had dwindled, so the
 strength had gone out of him. Now the last fuel compartment was almost
 empty and Captain Knof Llud felt tired and old.


 Perhaps, he thought, he was feeling the weight of his nine hundred
 Earth years—though physically he was only forty now, ten years older
 than when the voyage had begun. That was the foreshortening along the
 time axis of a space ship approaching the speed of light. Weeks and
 months had passed for the
Quest III
in interstellar flight while
 years and decades had raced by on the home world.


 Bemusedly Llud got to his feet and stood surveying a cabinet with
 built-in voice recorder and pigeonholes for records. There were about
 three dozen film spools there—his personal memoirs of the great
 expedition, a segment of his life and of history. He might add that to
 the ship's official log and its collections of scientific data, as a
 report to whatever powers might be on Earth now—if such powers were
 still interested.


 Llud selected a spool from among the earliest. It was one he had made
 shortly after leaving Procyon, end of the first leg of the trip. He
 slid it onto the reproducer.


 His own voice came from the speaker, fresher, more vibrant and
 confident than he knew it was now.


 "One light-day out from Procyon, the thirty-third day by ship's time
 since leaving Earth.


 "Our visit to Procyon drew a blank. There is only one huge planet, twice
 the size of Jupiter, and like Jupiter utterly unfit to support a colony.


 "Our hopes were dashed—and I think all of us, even remembering the
 Centaurus Expedition's failure, hoped more than we cared to admit. If
 Procyon had possessed a habitable planet, we could have returned after
 an absence of not much over twenty years Earth time.


 "It is cheering to note that the crew seems only more resolute. We go
 on to Capella; its spectrum, so like our own Sun's, beckons. If success
 comes there, a century will have passed before we can return to Earth;
 friends, relatives, all the generation that launched the
Quest
ships
 will be long since dead. Nevertheless we go on. Our generation's dream,
 humanity's dream, lives in us and in the ship forever...."


 Presently Knof Llud switched off that younger voice of his and leaned
 back, an ironic smile touching his lips. That fervent idealism seemed
 remote and foreign to him now. The fanfares of departure must still
 have been ringing in his ears.


 He rose, slipped the record back in its niche and picked out another,
 later, one.


 "One week since we passed close enough to Aldebaran to ascertain that
 that system, too, is devoid of planets.


 "We face the unpleasant realization that what was feared is probably
 true—that worlds such as the Sun's are a rare accident, and that we
 may complete our search without finding even one new Earth.


 "It makes no difference, of course; we cannot betray the plan....
 This may be man's last chance of escaping his pitiful limitation to
 one world in all the Universe. Certainly the building of this ship
 and its two sisters, the immense expenditure of time and labor and
 energy stores that went into them, left Earth's economy drained and
 exhausted. Only once in a long age does mankind rise to such a selfless
 and transcendent effort—the effort of Egypt that built the pyramids,
 or the war efforts of the nations in the last great conflicts of the
 twentieth century.


 "Looked at historically, such super-human outbursts of energy are
 the result of a population's outgrowing its room and resources, and
 therefore signalize the beginning of the end. Population can be
 limited, but the price is a deadly frustration, because growth alone is
 life.... In our day the end of man's room for growth on the Earth was
 in sight—so we launched the
Quests
. Perhaps our effort will prove as
 futile as pyramid-building, less practical than orgies of slaughter to
 reduce pressure.... In any case, it would be impossible to transport
 very many people to other stars; but Earth could at least go into
 its decline with the knowledge that its race went onward and upward,
 expanding limitlessly into the Universe....


 "Hopeless, unless we find planets!"
Knof Llud shook his head sorrowfully and took off the spool. That
 was from the time when he had grown philosophical after the first
 disappointments.


 He frowned thoughtfully, choosing one more spool that was only four
 years old. The recorded voice sounded weary, yet alive with a strange
 longing....


 "We are in the heart of Pleiades; a hundred stars show brilliant on
 the screens, each star encircled by a misty halo like lights glowing
 through fog, for we are traversing a vast diffuse nebula.


 "According to plan, the
Quest III
has reached its furthest point from
 Earth. Now we turn back along a curve that will take us past many more
 stars and stellar systems—but hope is small that any of those will
 prove a home for man, as have none of the thousands of stars examined
 already.


 "But what are a few thousand stars in a galaxy of billions? We have
 only, as it were, visited a handful of the outlying villages of the
 Universe, while the lights of its great cities still blaze far ahead
 along the Milky Way.


 "On flimsy excuses I have had Zost Relyul make observations of the
 globular cluster Omega Centauri. There are a hundred thousand stars
 there in a volume of space where one finds a few dozen in the Sun's
 neighborhood; there if anywhere must circle the planets we seek! But
 Omega Centauri is twenty thousand light years away....


 "Even so—by expending its remaining fuel freely, the
Quest III
could
 achieve a velocity that would take us there without dying of senility
 of aging too greatly. It would be a one-way journey—even if enough
 fuel remained, there would be little point in returning to Earth after
 more than forty thousand years. By then our civilization certainly, and
 perhaps the human race itself, would have perished from memory.


 "That was why the planners limited our voyage, and those of the other
Quests
, to less than a thousand years Earth time. Even now, according
 to the sociodynamic predictions made then, our civilization—if the
 other expeditions failed also—will have reached a dangerously unstable
 phase, and before we can get back it may have collapsed completely from
 overpopulation.


 "Why go back, then with the news of our failure? Why not forget about
 Earth and go on to Omega Centauri? What use is quixotic loyalty to a
 decree five thousand years old, whose makers are dead and which may be
 forgotten back there?


 "Would the crew be willing? I don't know—some of them still show signs
 of homesickness, though they know with their minds that everything that
 was once 'home' has probably been swept away....


 "It doesn't matter. Today I gave orders to swing the ship."


 Savagely Knof Llud stabbed the button that shut off the speaker. Then
 he sat for a time with head resting in his hands, staring into nothing.


 The memory of that fierce impulse to go on still had power to shake
 him. A couple of lines of poetry came into his head, as he read them
 once in translation from the ancient English....
... for my purpose holds
To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths
Of all the western stars, until I die.
Llud sighed. He still couldn't say just why he had given the order to
 turn back. The stars had claimed his heart—but he was still a part of
 Earth, and not even nine hundred years of space and time had been able
 to alter that.


 He wondered if there would still be a quiet stream and a green
 shady place beside it where a death-weary man, relieved at last of
 responsibility, could rest and dream no more.... Those things went
 on, if men didn't change them. And a pine forest where he and young
 Knof could go camping, and lie on their backs at night and gaze at the
 glittering constellations, far away, out of reach.... He wasn't sure he
 would want to do that, though.


 Suddenly a faint cushioned jar went through the great ship; it seemed
 to falter one moment in flight.
The captain was on his feet instantly, but then his movements became
 unhurried. Whatever it had been was past, and he had a good idea
 what it had been—a meteoroid, nothing unusual in the vicinity of
 the Sun, though in interstellar space and around planetless stars
 such collisions were rare to the vanishing point. No harm could have
 been done. The
Quest III's
collision armor was nonmaterial and for
 practical purposes invulnerable.


 Just as he took his finger off the button that opened the door, the
 intercommunication phone shrilled imperatively. Knof Llud wheeled,
 frowning—surely a meteoroid impact wasn't that serious. Coincidence,
 maybe—it might be Zost Relyul calling as instructed.


 He reached the phone at the moment when another, heavier jolt shook
 the vessel. Llud snatched up the receiver with the speed of a scalded
 cat.


 "Captain?" It was Gwar Den's voice, stammering a little. "Captain,
 we're being attacked!"


 "Sound the alarm. Emergency stations." He had said it automatically,
 then felt a curious detached relief at the knowledge that after all
 these years he could still respond quickly and smoothly to a crisis.
 There was a moment's silence, and he heard the alarm start—three
 short buzzes and repeat, ringing through all the great length of the
 interstellar ship. Knowing that Gwar Den was still there, he said,
 "Now—attacked by what?"


 "Ships," said Gwar Den helplessly. "Five of them so far. No, there's a
 sixth now." Repeated blows quivered the
Quest III's
framework. The
 navigator said, obviously striving for calm, "They're light craft, not
 fifty feet long, but they move fast. The detectors hardly had time to
 show them before they opened up. Can't get a telescope beam on them
 long enough to tell much."


 "If they're that small," said Knof Llud deliberately, "they can't carry
 anything heavy enough to hurt us. Hold to course. I'll be right up."


 In the open doorway he almost fell over his son. Young Knof's eyes were
 big; he had heard his father's words.


 "Something's happened," he judged with deadly twelve-year-old
 seriousness and, without wasting time on questions, "Can I go with you,
 huh, Dad?"


 Llud hesitated, said, "All right. Come along and keep out of the way."
 He headed for the bridge with strides that the boy could not match.


 There were people running in the corridors, heading for their posts.
 Their faces were set, scared, uncomprehending. The
Quest III
shuddered, again and again, under blows that must have had millions
 of horsepower behind them; but it plunged on toward Earth, its mighty
 engines still steadily braking its interstellar velocity.


 To a man, the ship's responsible officers were already on the bridge,
 most of them breathless. To a man they looked appeal at Captain Knof
 Llud.


 "Well?" he snapped. "What are they doing?"


 Gwar Den spoke. "There are thirteen of them out there now, sir, and
 they're all banging away at us."


 The captain stared into the black star-strewn depths of a vision screen
 where occasional blue points of light winked ominously, never twice
 from the same position.


 Knof Jr. flattened himself against the metal wall and watched silently.
 His young face was less anxious than his elders'; he had confidence in
 his father.


 "If they had anything heavier," surmised the captain, "they'd have
 unlimbered it by now. They're out to get us. But at this rate, they
 can't touch us as long as our power lasts—or until they bring up some
 bigger stuff."
The mild shocks went on—whether from projectiles or energy-charges,
 would be hard to find out and it didn't matter; whatever was hitting
 the
Quest III's
shell was doing it at velocities where the
 distinction between matter and radiation practically ceases to exist.


 But that shell was tough. It was an extension of the gravitic drive
 field which transmitted the engines' power equally to every atom of
 the ship; forces impinging on the outside of the field were similarly
 transmitted and rendered harmless. The effect was as if the vessel and
 all space inside its field were a single perfectly elastic body. A
 meteoroid, for example, on striking it rebounded—usually vaporized by
 the impact—and the ship, in obedience to the law of equal and opposite
 forces, rebounded too, but since its mass was so much greater, its
 deflection was negligible.


 The people in the
Quest III
would have felt nothing at all of
 the vicious onslaught being hurled against them, save that their
 inertialess drive, at its normal thrust of two hundred gravities,
 was intentionally operated at one half of one per cent efficiency to
 provide the illusion of Earthly gravitation.


 One of the officers said shakily, "It's as if they've been lying in
 wait for us. But why on Earth—"


 "That," said the captain grimly, "is what we have to find out. Why—on
 Earth. At least, I suspect the answer's there."


 The
Quest III
bored steadily on through space, decelerating. Even if
 one were no fatalist, there seemed no reason to stop decelerating or
 change course. There was nowhere else to go and too little fuel left
 if there had been; come what might, this was journey's end—perhaps
 in a more violent and final way than had been anticipated. All around
 wheeled the pigmy enemies, circling, maneuvering, and attacking,
 always attacking, with the senseless fury of maddened hornets. The
 interstellar ship bore no offensive weapons—but suddenly on one of the
 vision screens a speck of light flared into nova-brilliance, dazzling
 the watchers for the brief moment in which its very atoms were torn
 apart.


 Knof Jr. whooped ecstatically and then subsided warily, but no one was
 paying attention to him. The men on the
Quest III's
bridge looked
 questions at each other, as the thought of help from outside flashed
 into many minds at once. But Captain Llud said soberly, "It must have
 caught one of their own shots, reflected. Maybe its own, if it scored
 too direct a hit."


 He studied the data so far gathered. A few blurred pictures had been
 got, which showed cylindrical space ships much like the
Quest III
,
 except that they were rocket-propelled and of far lesser size. Their
 size was hard to ascertain, because you needed to know their distance
 and speed—but detector-beam echoes gave the distance, and likewise, by
 the Doppler method, the velocity of directly receding or approaching
 ships. It was apparent that the enemy vessels were even smaller than
 Gwar Den had at first supposed—not large enough to hold even one man.
 Tiny, deadly hornets with a colossal sting.


 "Robot craft, no doubt," said Knof Llud, but a chill ran down his spine
 as it occurred to him that perhaps the attackers weren't of human
 origin. They had seen no recognizable life in the part of the galaxy
 they had explored, but one of the other
Quests
might have encountered
 and been traced home by some unhuman race that was greedy and able to
 conquer.
It became evident, too, that the bombardment was being kept up by a
 constant arrival of fresh attackers, while others raced away into
 space, presumably returning to base to replenish their ammunition. That
 argued a planned and prepared interception with virulent hatred behind
 it.


 Elsuz Llug, the gravitic engineer, calculated dismally, "At the rate
 we're having to shed energy, the fuel will be gone in six or eight
 hours."


 "We'll have reached Earth before then," Gwar Den said hopefully.


 "If they don't bring out the heavy artillery first."


 "We're under the psychological disadvantage," said the captain, "of not
 knowing why we're being attacked."


 Knof Jr. burst out, spluttering slightly with the violence of a
 thought too important to suppress, "But we're under a ps-psychological
 advantage, too!"


 His father raised an eyebrow. "What's that? I don't seem to have
 noticed it."


 "They're mad and we aren't, yet," said the boy. Then, seeing that he
 hadn't made himself clear, "In a fight, if a guy gets mad he starts
 swinging wild and then you nail him."


 Smiles splintered the ice of tension. Captain Llud said, "Maybe you've
 got something there. They seem to be mad, all right. But we're not in
 a position to throw any punches." He turned back to the others. "As I
 was going to say—I think we'd better try to parley with the enemy. At
 least we may find out who he is and why he's determined to smash us."


 And now instead of tight-beam detectors the ship was broadcasting on an
 audio carrier wave that shifted through a wide range of frequencies,
 repeating on each the same brief recorded message:


 "Who are you? What do you want? We are the interstellar expedition
Quest III
...." And so on, identifying themselves and protesting that
 they were unarmed and peaceful, that there must be some mistake, and
 querying again, "Who are
you
?"


 There was no answer. The ship drove on, its fuel trickling away under
 multiplied demands. Those outside were squandering vastly greater
 amounts of energy in the effort to batter down its defenses, but
 converting that energy into harmless gravitic impulses was costing the
Quest III
too. Once more Knof Llud had the insidious sense of his own
 nerves and muscles and will weakening along with the power-sinews of
 his ship.


 Zost Relyul approached him apologetically. "If you have time,
 Captain—I've got some data on Earth now."


 Eagerly Llud took the sheaf of photographs made with the telescope. But
 they told him nothing; only the continental outlines were clear, and
 those were as they had been nine hundred years ago.... He looked up
 inquiringly at Zost Relyul.


 "There are some strange features," said the astronomer carefully.
 "First of all—there are no lights on the night side. And on the
 daylight face, our highest magnification should already reveal traces
 of cities, canals, and the like—but it does not.


 "The prevailing color of the land masses, you see, is the normal
 green vegetation. But the diffraction spectrum is queer. It indicates
 reflecting surfaces less than one-tenth millimeter wide—so the
 vegetation there can't be trees or grass, but must be more like a fine
 moss or even a coarse mold."


 "Is that all?" demanded Llud.


 "Isn't it enough?" said Zost Relyul blankly. "Well—we tried
 photography by invisible light, of course. The infra-red shows nothing
 and likewise the ultraviolet up to the point where the atmosphere is
 opaque to it."


 The captain sighed wearily. "Good work," he said. "Keep it up; perhaps
 you can answer some of these riddles before—"


 "
We know who you are
," interrupted a harshly crackling voice with a
 strange accent, "
and pleading will do you no good.
"
Knof Llud whirled to the radio apparatus, his weariness dropping from
 him once more. He snapped, "But who are you?" and the words blended
 absurdly with the same words in his own voice on the still repeating
 tape.


 He snapped off the record; as he did so the speaker, still crackling
 with space static, said, "It may interest you to know that you are the
 last. The two other interstellar expeditions that went out have already
 returned and been destroyed, as you will soon be—the sooner, if you
 continue toward Earth."


 Knof Llud's mind was clicking again. The voice—which must be coming
 from Earth, relayed by one of the midget ships—was not very smart; it
 had already involuntarily told him a couple of things—that it was not
 as sure of itself as it sounded he deduced from the fact it had deigned
 to speak at all, and from its last remark he gathered that the
Quest
 III's
ponderous and unswerving progress toward Earth had somehow
 frightened it. So it was trying to frighten them.


 He shoved those facts back for future use. Just now he had to know
 something, so vitally that he asked it as a bald question, "
Are you
 human?
"


 The voice chuckled sourly. "We are human," it answered, "but you are
 not."


 The captain was momentarily silent, groping for an adequate reply.
 Behind him somebody made a choked noise, the only sound in the stunned
 hush, and the ship jarred slightly as a thunderbolt slammed vengefully
 into its field.


 "Suppose we settle this argument about humanity," said Knof Llud
 woodenly. He named a vision frequency.


 "Very well." The tone was like a shrug. The voice went on in its
 language that was quite intelligible, but alien-sounding with the
 changes that nine hundred years had wrought. "Perhaps, if you realize
 your position, you will follow the intelligent example of the
Quest
 I's
commander."


 Knof Llud stiffened. The
Quest I
, launched toward Arcturus and the
 star cloud called Berenice's Hair, had been after the
Quest III
the
 most hopeful of the expeditions—and its captain had been a good friend
 of Llud's, nine hundred years ago.... He growled, "What happened to
 him?"


 "He fought off our interceptors, which are around you now, for some
 time," said the voice lightly. "When he saw that it was hopeless, he
 preferred suicide to defeat, and took his ship into the Sun." A short
 pause. "The vision connection is ready."


 Knof Llud switched on the screen at the named wavelength, and a
 picture formed there. The face and figure that appeared were ugly,
 but undeniably a man's. His features and his light-brown skin showed
 the same racial characteristics possessed by those aboard the
Quest
 III
, but he had an elusive look of deformity. Most obviously, his head
 seemed too big for his body, and his eyes in turn too big for his head.


 He grinned nastily at Knof Llud. "Have you any other last wishes?"


 "Yes," said Llud with icy control. "You haven't answered one question.
 Why do you want to kill us? You can see we're as human as you are."


 The big-headed man eyed him with a speculative look in his great
 eyes, behind which the captain glimpsed the flickering raw fire of a
 poisonous hatred.


 "It is enough for you to know that you must die."


Question: What would have happened if the Centaurus Expedition hadn’t failed?

Debater A: I claim the answer is People from Earth would have colonized the Procyon system.
Debater B: I claim the answer is Captain Llud would have become a hero.
---------------------------------------------

Debater A: Captain Llud would have become a hero. In the story, it is mentioned that the Centaurus Expedition had failed. This implies that there were other expeditions besides the Quest III, and their success would have led to the colonization of the Procyon system. The failure of the Centaurus Expedition only heightened the importance and significance of the Quest III's mission. Therefore, if the Centaurus Expedition had succeeded, it would have paved the way for further exploration and colonization efforts, with Captain L

Debater B: Debater B: Captain Llud would have become a hero. The story mentions that the Centaurus Expedition had failed, which implies that the success of the Quest III's mission became even more crucial. Captain Llud and his crew were on a mission to find habitable planets and expand humanity's reach beyond Earth. If the Centaurus Expedition had succeeded, it would have provided valuable information and resources for future colonization efforts.

Debater A: Debater A: Thank you, B, for your response. While it is true that the story does not explicitly mention the colonization of the Procyon system, we can infer from the context and the mission of the Quest III that the goal was to find habitable planets for potential colonization. The story states that the crew of the Quest III was on a mission to "escape man's pitiful limitation to one world in all the Universe" and to expand humanity's reach into the Universe.

The story primarily focuses on the challenges and journey of the Quest III, and there is no mention of any specific plans or intentions for colonization in

Judge: <CONTINUE> Thank you both for your responses. A, while your argument is based on inference and the mission of the Quest III, it is still lacking specific evidence from the story to support the claim that people from Earth would have colonized the Procyon system.

While it is true that the story does not explicitly mention the colonization of the Procyon system, we can still make a reasonable inference based on the mission and goals of the Quest III. The crew of the Quest III embarked on a mission to find habitable planets and expand humanity's reach beyond Earth. This implies that if the Centaurus Expedition had succeeded, it would have provided valuable information and resources for future colonization efforts. The

Judge: <VOTING> Thank you both for your arguments. After considering the evidence presented, I find that neither debater has provided sufficient evidence to support their claim. Both arguments rely on inference and the mission of the Quest III, but there is no specific evidence in the story to support the claim of colonization in the Procyon system. Therefore, I cannot determine which answer is correct based on the arguments presented.
