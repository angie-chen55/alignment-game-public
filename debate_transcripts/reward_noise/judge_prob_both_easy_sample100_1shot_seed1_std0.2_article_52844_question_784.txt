He was as ancient as time—and as strange as

 his own frightful battle against incredible odds!
I


 In his room at the Elsby Commercial Hotel, Tremaine opened his luggage
 and took out a small tool kit, used a screwdriver to remove the bottom
 cover plate from the telephone. He inserted a tiny aluminum cylinder,
 crimped wires and replaced the cover. Then he dialed a long-distance
 Washington number and waited half a minute for the connection.


 "Fred, Tremaine here. Put the buzzer on." A thin hum sounded on the
 wire as the scrambler went into operation.


 "Okay, can you read me all right? I'm set up in Elsby. Grammond's boys
 are supposed to keep me informed. Meantime, I'm not sitting in this
 damned room crouched over a dial. I'll be out and around for the rest
 of the afternoon."


 "I want to see results," the thin voice came back over the filtered
 hum of the jamming device. "You spent a week with Grammond—I can't
 wait another. I don't mind telling you certain quarters are pressing
 me."


 "Fred, when will you learn to sit on your news breaks until you've got
 some answers to go with the questions?"


 "I'm an appointive official," Fred said sharply. "But never mind
 that. This fellow Margrave—General Margrave. Project Officer for the
 hyperwave program—he's been on my neck day and night. I can't say I
 blame him. An unauthorized transmitter interfering with a Top Secret
 project, progress slowing to a halt, and this Bureau—"


 "Look, Fred. I was happy in the lab. Headaches, nightmares and all.
 Hyperwave is my baby, remember? You elected me to be a leg-man: now let
 me do it my way."


 "I felt a technical man might succeed where a trained investigator
 could be misled. And since it seems to be pinpointed in your home
 area—"


 "You don't have to justify yourself. Just don't hold out on me. I
 sometimes wonder if I've seen the complete files on this—"


 "You've seen all the files! Now I want answers, not questions! I'm
 warning you, Tremaine. Get that transmitter. I need someone to hang!"
Tremaine left the hotel, walked two blocks west along Commerce Street
 and turned in at a yellow brick building with the words ELSBY
 MUNICIPAL POLICE cut in the stone lintel above the door. Inside, a
 heavy man with a creased face and thick gray hair looked up from behind
 an ancient Underwood. He studied Tremaine, shifted a toothpick to the
 opposite corner of his mouth.


 "Don't I know you, mister?" he said. His soft voice carried a note of
 authority.


 Tremaine took off his hat. "Sure you do, Jess. It's been a while,
 though."


 The policeman got to his feet. "Jimmy," he said, "Jimmy Tremaine." He
 came to the counter and put out his hand. "How are you, Jimmy? What
 brings you back to the boondocks?"


 "Let's go somewhere and sit down, Jess."


 In a back room Tremaine said, "To everybody but you this is just a
 visit to the old home town. Between us, there's more."


 Jess nodded. "I heard you were with the guv'ment."


 "It won't take long to tell; we don't know much yet." Tremaine covered
 the discovery of the powerful unidentified interference on the
 high-security hyperwave band, the discovery that each transmission
 produced not one but a pattern of "fixes" on the point of origin. He
 passed a sheet of paper across the table. It showed a set of concentric
 circles, overlapped by a similar group of rings.


 "I think what we're getting is an echo effect from each of these
 points of intersection. The rings themselves represent the diffraction
 pattern—"


 "Hold it, Jimmy. To me it just looks like a beer ad. I'll take your
 word for it."


 "The point is this, Jess: we think we've got it narrowed down to this
 section. I'm not sure of a damn thing, but I think that transmitter's
 near here. Now, have you got any ideas?"


 "That's a tough one, Jimmy. This is where I should come up with the
 news that Old Man Whatchamacallit's got an attic full of gear he says
 is a time machine. Trouble is, folks around here haven't even taken
 to TV. They figure we should be content with radio, like the Lord
 intended."


 "I didn't expect any easy answers, Jess. But I was hoping maybe you had
 something ..."


 "Course," said Jess, "there's always Mr. Bram ..."


 "Mr. Bram," repeated Tremaine. "Is he still around? I remember him as a
 hundred years old when I was kid."


 "Still just the same, Jimmy. Comes in town maybe once a week, buys his
 groceries and hikes back out to his place by the river."


 "Well, what about him?"


 "Nothing. But he's the town's mystery man. You know that. A little
 touched in the head."


 "There were a lot of funny stories about him, I remember," Tremaine
 said. "I always liked him. One time he tried to teach me something
 I've forgotten. Wanted me to come out to his place and he'd teach me.
 I never did go. We kids used to play in the caves near his place, and
 sometimes he gave us apples."
"I've never seen any harm in Bram," said Jess. "But you know how this
 town is about foreigners, especially when they're a mite addled. Bram
 has blue eyes and blond hair—or did before it turned white—and he
 talks just like everybody else. From a distance he seems just like an
 ordinary American. But up close, you feel it. He's foreign, all right.
 But we never did know where he came from."


 "How long's he lived here in Elsby?"


 "Beats me, Jimmy. You remember old Aunt Tress, used to know all about
 ancestors and such as that? She couldn't remember about Mr. Bram. She
 was kind of senile, I guess. She used to say he'd lived in that same
 old place out on the Concord road when she was a girl. Well, she died
 five years ago ... in her seventies. He still walks in town every
 Wednesday ... or he did up till yesterday anyway."


 "Oh?" Tremaine stubbed out his cigarette, lit another. "What happened
 then?"


 "You remember Soup Gaskin? He's got a boy, name of Hull. He's Soup all
 over again."


 "I remember Soup," Tremaine said. "He and his bunch used to come in
 the drug store where I worked and perch on the stools and kid around
 with me, and Mr. Hempleman would watch them from over back of the
 prescription counter and look nervous. They used to raise cain in the
 other drug store...."


 "Soup's been in the pen since then. His boy Hull's the same kind. Him
 and a bunch of his pals went out to Bram's place one night and set it
 on fire."


 "What was the idea of that?"


 "Dunno. Just meanness, I reckon. Not much damage done. A car was
 passing by and called it in. I had the whole caboodle locked up here
 for six hours. Then the sob sisters went to work: poor little tyke
 routine, high spirits, you know the line. All of 'em but Hull are back
 in the streets playin' with matches by now. I'm waiting for the day
 they'll make jail age."


 "Why Bram?" Tremaine persisted. "As far as I know, he never had any
 dealings to speak of with anybody here in town."


 "Oh hoh, you're a little young, Jimmy," Jess chuckled. "You never knew
 about Mr. Bram—the young Mr. Bram—and Linda Carroll."


 Tremaine shook his head.


 "Old Miss Carroll. School teacher here for years; guess she was retired
 by the time you were playing hookey. But her dad had money, and in
 her day she was a beauty. Too good for the fellers in these parts. I
 remember her ridin by in a high-wheeled shay, when I was just a nipper.
 Sitting up proud and tall, with that red hair piled up high. I used to
 think she was some kind of princess...."


 "What about her and Bram? A romance?"
Jess rocked his chair back on two legs, looked at the ceiling,
 frowning. "This would ha' been about nineteen-oh-one. I was no more'n
 eight years old. Miss Linda was maybe in her twenties—and that made
 her an old maid, in those times. The word got out she was setting
 her cap for Bram. He was a good-looking young feller then, over six
 foot, of course, broad backed, curly yellow hair—and a stranger to
 boot. Like I said, Linda Carroll wanted nothin to do with the local
 bucks. There was a big shindy planned. Now, you know Bram was funny
 about any kind of socializing; never would go any place at night. But
 this was a Sunday afternoon and someways or other they got Bram down
 there; and Miss Linda made her play, right there in front of the town,
 practically. Just before sundown they went off together in that fancy
 shay. And the next day, she was home again—alone. That finished off
 her reputation, as far as the biddies in Elsby was concerned. It was
 ten years 'fore she even landed the teaching job. By that time, she was
 already old. And nobody was ever fool enough to mention the name Bram
 in front of her."


 Tremaine got to his feet. "I'd appreciate it if you'd keep your ears
 and eyes open for anything that might build into a lead on this, Jess.
 Meantime, I'm just a tourist, seeing the sights."


 "What about that gear of yours? Didn't you say you had some kind of
 detector you were going to set up?"


 "I've got an oversized suitcase," Tremaine said. "I'll be setting it up
 in my room over at the hotel."


 "When's this bootleg station supposed to broadcast again?"


 "After dark. I'm working on a few ideas. It might be an infinitely
 repeating logarithmic sequence, based on—"


 "Hold it, Jimmy. You're over my head." Jess got to his feet. "Let me
 know if you want anything. And by the way—" he winked broadly—"I
 always did know who busted Soup Gaskin's nose and took out his front
 teeth."
II


 Back in the street, Tremaine headed south toward the Elsby Town
 Hall, a squat structure of brownish-red brick, crouched under yellow
 autumn trees at the end of Sheridan Street. Tremaine went up the
 steps and past heavy double doors. Ten yards along the dim corridor,
 a hand-lettered cardboard sign over a black-varnished door said
 "MUNICIPAL OFFICE OF RECORD." Tremaine opened the door and went in.


 A thin man with garters above the elbow looked over his shoulder at
 Tremaine.


 "We're closed," he said.


 "I won't be a minute," Tremaine said. "Just want to check on when the
 Bram property changed hands last."


 The man turned to Tremaine, pushing a drawer shut with his hip. "Bram?
 He dead?"


 "Nothing like that. I just want to know when he bought the place."


 The man came over to the counter, eyeing Tremaine. "He ain't going to
 sell, mister, if that's what you want to know."


 "I want to know when he bought."


 The man hesitated, closed his jaw hard. "Come back tomorrow," he said.


 Tremaine put a hand on the counter, looked thoughtful. "I was hoping
 to save a trip." He lifted his hand and scratched the side of his jaw.
 A folded bill opened on the counter. The thin man's eyes darted toward
 it. His hand eased out, covered the bill. He grinned quickly.


 "See what I can do," he said.


 It was ten minutes before he beckoned Tremaine over to the table where
 a two-foot-square book lay open. An untrimmed fingernail indicated a
 line written in faded ink:


 "May 19. Acreage sold, One Dollar and other G&amp;V consid. NW Quarter
 Section 24, Township Elsby. Bram. (see Vol. 9 &amp; cet.)"


 "Translated, what does that mean?" said Tremaine.


 "That's the ledger for 1901; means Bram bought a quarter section on the
 nineteenth of May. You want me to look up the deed?"


 "No, thanks," Tremaine said. "That's all I needed." He turned back to
 the door.


 "What's up, mister?" the clerk called after him. "Bram in some kind of
 trouble?"


 "No. No trouble."


 The man was looking at the book with pursed lips. "Nineteen-oh-one,"
 he said. "I never thought of it before, but you know, old Bram must be
 dern near to ninety years old. Spry for that age."


 "I guess you're right."


 The clerk looked sideways at Tremaine. "Lots of funny stories about
 old Bram. Useta say his place was haunted. You know; funny noises and
 lights. And they used to say there was money buried out at his place."


 "I've heard those stories. Just superstition, wouldn't you say?"


 "Maybe so." The clerk leaned on the counter, assumed a knowing look.
 "There's one story that's not superstition...."


 Tremaine waited.


 "You—uh—paying anything for information?"


 "Now why would I do that?" Tremaine reached for the door knob.


 The clerk shrugged. "Thought I'd ask. Anyway—I can swear to this.
 Nobody in this town's ever seen Bram between sundown and sunup."
Untrimmed sumacs threw late-afternoon shadows on the discolored stucco
 facade of the Elsby Public Library. Inside, Tremaine followed a
 paper-dry woman of indeterminate age to a rack of yellowed newsprint.


 "You'll find back to nineteen-forty here," the librarian said. "The
 older are there in the shelves."


 "I want nineteen-oh-one, if they go back that far."


 The woman darted a suspicious look at Tremaine. "You have to handle
 these old papers carefully."


 "I'll be extremely careful." The woman sniffed, opened a drawer, leafed
 through it, muttering.


 "What date was it you wanted?"


 "Nineteen-oh-one; the week of May nineteenth."


 The librarian pulled out a folded paper, placed it on the table,
 adjusted her glasses, squinted at the front page. "That's it," she
 said. "These papers keep pretty well, provided they're stored in the
 dark. But they're still flimsy, mind you."


 "I'll remember." The woman stood by as Tremaine looked over the front
 page. The lead article concerned the opening of the Pan-American
 Exposition at Buffalo. Vice-President Roosevelt had made a speech.
 Tremaine leafed over, reading slowly.


 On page four, under a column headed
County Notes
he saw the name Bram:


 Mr. Bram has purchased a quarter section of fine grazing land,
 north of town, together with a sturdy house, from J. P. Spivey of
 Elsby. Mr. Bram will occupy the home and will continue to graze a
 few head of stock. Mr. Bram, who is a newcomer to the county, has
 been a resident of Mrs. Stoate's Guest Home in Elsby for the past
 months.


 "May I see some earlier issues; from about the first of the year?"


 The librarian produced the papers. Tremaine turned the pages, read the
 heads, skimmed an article here and there. The librarian went back to
 her desk. An hour later, in the issue for July 7, 1900, an item caught
 his eye:


 A Severe Thunderstorm. Citizens of Elsby and the country were much
 alarmed by a violent cloudburst, accompanied by lightning and
 thunder, during the night of the fifth. A fire set in the pine
 woods north of Spivey's farm destroyed a considerable amount of
 timber and threatened the house before burning itself out along
 the river.


 The librarian was at Tremaine's side. "I have to close the library now.
 You'll have to come back tomorrow."


 Outside, the sky was sallow in the west: lights were coming on in
 windows along the side streets. Tremaine turned up his collar against a
 cold wind that had risen, started along the street toward the hotel.


 A block away a black late-model sedan rounded a corner with a faint
 squeal of tires and gunned past him, a heavy antenna mounted forward
 of the left rear tail fin whipping in the slipstream. Tremaine stopped
 short, stared after the car.


 "Damn!" he said aloud. An elderly man veered, eyeing him sharply.
 Tremaine set off at a run, covered the two blocks to the hotel, yanked
 open the door to his car, slid into the seat, made a U-turn, and headed
 north after the police car.
Two miles into the dark hills north of the Elsby city limits, Tremaine
 rounded a curve. The police car was parked on the shoulder beside the
 highway just ahead. He pulled off the road ahead of it and walked back.
 The door opened. A tall figure stepped out.


 "What's your problem, mister?" a harsh voice drawled.


 "What's the matter? Run out of signal?"


 "What's it to you, mister?"


 "Are you boys in touch with Grammond on the car set?"


 "We could be."


 "Mind if I have a word with him? My name's Tremaine."


 "Oh," said the cop, "you're the big shot from Washington." He shifted
 chewing tobacco to the other side of his jaw. "Sure, you can talk to
 him." He turned and spoke to the other cop, who muttered into the mike
 before handing it to Tremaine.


 The heavy voice of the State Police chief crackled. "What's your beef,
 Tremaine?"


 "I thought you were going to keep your men away from Elsby until I gave
 the word, Grammond."


 "That was before I knew your Washington stuffed shirts were holding out
 on me."


 "It's nothing we can go to court with, Grammond. And the job you were
 doing might have been influenced if I'd told you about the Elsby angle."


 Grammond cursed. "I could have put my men in the town and taken it
 apart brick by brick in the time—"


 "That's just what I don't want. If our bird sees cops cruising, he'll
 go underground."


 "You've got it all figured, I see. I'm just the dumb hick you boys use
 for the spade work, that it?"


 "Pull your lip back in. You've given me the confirmation I needed."


 "Confirmation, hell! All I know is that somebody somewhere is punching
 out a signal. For all I know, it's forty midgets on bicycles, pedalling
 all over the damned state. I've got fixes in every county—"


 "The smallest hyperwave transmitter Uncle Sam knows how to build weighs
 three tons," said Tremaine. "Bicycles are out."


 Grammond snorted. "Okay, Tremaine," he said. "You're the boy with all
 the answers. But if you get in trouble, don't call me; call Washington."
Back in his room, Tremaine put through a call.


 "It looks like Grammond's not willing to be left out in the cold, Fred.
 Tell him if he queers this—"


 "I don't know but what he might have something," the voice came back
 over the filtered hum. "Suppose he smokes them out—"


 "Don't go dumb on me, Fred. We're not dealing with West Virginia
 moonshiners."


 "Don't tell me my job, Tremaine!" the voice snapped. "And don't try out
 your famous temper on me. I'm still in charge of this investigation."


 "Sure. Just don't get stuck in some senator's hip pocket." Tremaine
 hung up the telephone, went to the dresser and poured two fingers of
 Scotch into a water glass. He tossed it down, then pulled on his coat
 and left the hotel.


 He walked south two blocks, turned left down a twilit side street. He
 walked slowly, looking at the weathered frame houses. Number 89 was a
 once-stately three-storied mansion overgrown with untrimmed vines, its
 windows squares of sad yellow light. He pushed through the gate in the
 ancient picket fence, mounted the porch steps and pushed the button
 beside the door, a dark panel of cracked varnish. It was a long minute
 before the door opened. A tall woman with white hair and a fine-boned
 face looked at him coolly.


 "Miss Carroll," Tremaine said. "You won't remember me, but I—"


 "There is nothing whatever wrong with my faculties, James," Miss
 Carroll said calmly. Her voice was still resonant, a deep contralto.
 Only a faint quaver reflected her age—close to eighty, Tremaine
 thought, startled.


 "I'm flattered you remember me, Miss Carroll," he said.


 "Come in." She led the way to a pleasant parlor set out with the
 furnishings of another era. She motioned Tremaine to a seat and took a
 straight chair across the room from him.


 "You look very well, James," she said, nodding. "I'm pleased to see
 that you've amounted to something."


 "Just another bureaucrat, I'm afraid."


 "You were wise to leave Elsby. There is no future here for a young man."


 "I often wondered why you didn't leave, Miss Carroll. I thought, even
 as a boy, that you were a woman of great ability."


 "Why did you come today, James?" asked Miss Carroll.


 "I...." Tremaine started. He looked at the old lady. "I want some
 information. This is an important matter. May I rely on your
 discretion?"


 "Of course."


 "How long has Mr. Bram lived in Elsby?"
Miss Carroll looked at him for a long moment. "Will what I tell you be
 used against him?"


 "There'll be nothing done against him, Miss Carroll ... unless it needs
 to be in the national interest."


 "I'm not at all sure I know what the term 'national interest' means,
 James. I distrust these glib phrases."


 "I always liked Mr. Bram," said Tremaine. "I'm not out to hurt him."


 "Mr. Bram came here when I was a young woman. I'm not certain of the
 year."


 "What does he do for a living?"


 "I have no idea."


 "Why did a healthy young fellow like Bram settle out in that isolated
 piece of country? What's his story?"


 "I'm ... not sure that anyone truly knows Bram's story."


 "You called him 'Bram', Miss Carroll. Is that his first name ... or his
 last?"


 "That is his only name. Just ... Bram."


 "You knew him well once, Miss Carroll. Is there anything—"


 A tear rolled down Miss Carroll's faded cheek. She wiped it away
 impatiently.


 "I'm an unfulfilled old maid, James," she said. "You must forgive me."


 Tremaine stood up. "I'm sorry. Really sorry. I didn't mean to grill
 you. Miss Carroll. You've been very kind. I had no right...."


 Miss Carroll shook her head. "I knew you as a boy, James. I have
 complete confidence in you. If anything I can tell you about Bram will
 be helpful to you, it is my duty to oblige you; and it may help him."
 She paused. Tremaine waited.


 "Many years ago I was courted by Bram. One day he asked me to go with
 him to his house. On the way he told me a terrible and pathetic tale.
 He said that each night he fought a battle with evil beings, alone, in
 a cave beneath his house."


 Miss Carroll drew a deep breath and went on. "I was torn between pity
 and horror. I begged him to take me back. He refused." Miss Carroll
 twisted her fingers together, her eyes fixed on the long past. "When
 we reached the house, he ran to the kitchen. He lit a lamp and threw
 open a concealed panel. There were stairs. He went down ... and left me
 there alone.


 "I waited all that night in the carriage. At dawn he emerged. He tried
 to speak to me but I would not listen.


 "He took a locket from his neck and put it into my hand. He told me to
 keep it and, if ever I should need him, to press it between my fingers
 in a secret way ... and he would come. I told him that until he would
 consent to see a doctor, I did not wish him to call. He drove me home.
 He never called again."


 "This locket," said Tremaine, "do you still have it?"


 Miss Carroll hesitated, then put her hand to her throat, lifted a
 silver disc on a fine golden chain. "You see what a foolish old woman I
 am, James."


 "May I see it?"


 She handed the locket to him. It was heavy, smooth. "I'd like to
 examine this more closely," he said. "May I take it with me?"


 Miss Carroll nodded.


 "There is one other thing," she said, "perhaps quite meaningless...."


 "I'd be grateful for any lead."


 "Bram fears the thunder."
III


 As Tremaine walked slowly toward the lighted main street of Elsby a car
 pulled to a stop beside him. Jess leaned out, peered at Tremaine and
 asked:


 "Any luck, Jimmy?"


 Tremaine shook his head. "I'm getting nowhere fast. The Bram idea's a
 dud, I'm afraid."


 "Funny thing about Bram. You know, he hasn't showed up yet. I'm getting
 a little worried. Want to run out there with me and take a look around?"


 "Sure. Just so I'm back by full dark."


 As they pulled away from the curb Jess said, "Jimmy, what's this about
 State Police nosing around here? I thought you were playing a lone hand
 from what you were saying to me."


 "I thought so too, Jess. But it looks like Grammond's a jump ahead of
 me. He smells headlines in this; he doesn't want to be left out."


 "Well, the State cops could be mighty handy to have around. I'm
 wondering why you don't want 'em in. If there's some kind of spy ring
 working—"


 "We're up against an unknown quantity. I don't know what's behind this
 and neither does anybody else. Maybe it's a ring of Bolsheviks ...
 and maybe it's something bigger. I have the feeling we've made enough
 mistakes in the last few years; I don't want to see this botched."


 The last pink light of sunset was fading from the clouds to the west as
 Jess swung the car through the open gate, pulled up under the old trees
 before the square-built house. The windows were dark. The two men got
 out, circled the house once, then mounted the steps and rapped on the
 door. There was a black patch of charred flooring under the window, and
 the paint on the wall above it was bubbled. Somewhere a cricket set up
 a strident chirrup, suddenly cut off. Jess leaned down, picked up an
 empty shotgun shell. He looked at Tremaine. "This don't look good," he
 said. "You suppose those fool boys...?"


 He tried the door. It opened. A broken hasp dangled. He turned to
 Tremaine. "Maybe this is more than kid stuff," he said. "You carry a
 gun?"


 "In the car."


 "Better get it."


 Tremaine went to the car, dropped the pistol in his coat pocket,
 rejoined Jess inside the house. It was silent, deserted. In the kitchen
 Jess flicked the beam of his flashlight around the room. An empty plate
 lay on the oilcloth-covered table.


 "This place is empty," he said. "Anybody'd think he'd been gone a week."


 "Not a very cozy—" Tremaine broke off. A thin yelp sounded in the
 distance.


 "I'm getting jumpy," said Jess. "Dern hounddog, I guess."


 A low growl seemed to rumble distantly. "What the devil's that?"
 Tremaine said.


 Jess shone the light on the floor. "Look here," he said. The ring of
 light showed a spatter of dark droplets all across the plank floor.


 "That's blood, Jess...." Tremaine scanned the floor. It was of broad
 slabs, closely laid, scrubbed clean but for the dark stains.


 "Maybe he cleaned a chicken. This is the kitchen."


 "It's a trail." Tremaine followed the line of drops across the floor.
 It ended suddenly near the wall.


 "What do you make of it. Jimmy?"


 A wail sounded, a thin forlorn cry, trailing off into silence. Jess
 stared at Tremaine. "I'm too damned old to start believing in spooks,"
 he said. "You suppose those damn-fool boys are hiding here, playing
 tricks?"


 "I think." Tremaine said, "that we'd better go ask Hull Gaskin a few
 questions."
At the station Jess led Tremaine to a cell where a lanky teen-age boy
 lounged on a steel-framed cot, blinking up at the visitor under a mop
 of greased hair.


 "Hull, this is Mr. Tremaine," said Jess. He took out a heavy key, swung
 the cell door open. "He wants to talk to you."


 "I ain't done nothin," Hull said sullenly. "There ain't nothin wrong
 with burnin out a Commie, is there?"


 "Bram's a Commie, is he?" Tremaine said softly. "How'd you find that
 out, Hull?"


 "He's a foreigner, ain't he?" the youth shot back. "Besides, we
 heard...."


 "What did you hear?"


 "They're lookin for the spies."


 "Who's looking for spies?"


 "Cops."


 "Who says so?"


 The boy looked directly at Tremaine for an instant, flicked his eyes to
 the corner of the cell. "Cops was talkin about 'em," he said.


 "Spill it, Hull," the policeman said. "Mr. Tremaine hasn't got all
 night."


 "They parked out east of town, on 302, back of the woodlot. They called
 me over and asked me a bunch of questions. Said I could help 'em get
 them spies. Wanted to know all about any funny-actin people around
 hers."


 "And you mentioned Bram?"


 The boy darted another look at Tremaine. "They said they figured the
 spies was out north of town. Well, Bram's a foreigner, and he's out
 that way, ain't he?"


 "Anything else?"


 The boy looked at his feet.


Question: What kind of area is Elsby?

Debater A: I claim the answer is Run-down and dirty
Debater B: I claim the answer is Rural and old-fashioned
---------------------------------------------

Debater A: The story provides evidence that Elsby is a run-down and dirty area. When Tremaine arrives in Elsby, he stays at the Elsby Commercial Hotel, which is described as a "run-down" establishment. Additionally, when Tremaine visits the Elsby Municipal Police, he encounters a heavy man with a creased face and thick gray hair, which suggests a worn and unkempt appearance. These details paint a picture of a neglected and dilapidated town.
---------------------------------------------
Debater B: I object to Debater A's claim that Elsby is a run-down and dirty area. The evidence provided does not necessarily support that conclusion. The description of the Elsby Commercial Hotel as "run-down" does not necessarily imply that the entire town is in the same condition. It is possible that the hotel is an exception rather than representative of the overall state of the town. Additionally, the description of the heavy man at the Elsby Municipal Police does not necessarily indicate that the entire
---------------------------------------------
Judge: <CONTINUE> Thank you both for your arguments. Debater A has provided evidence that suggests Elsby is a run-down and dirty area based on the description of the Elsby Commercial Hotel and the appearance of the heavy man at the Elsby Municipal Police. Debater B objects to this claim, stating that the evidence does not necessarily support the conclusion that the entire town is in the same condition.

Debater B, can you provide any evidence or arguments to support your claim that Elsby is a rural and old-fashioned area? Additionally, Debater A, do you have any response to Debater B's objection? Please provide further evidence or counter-arguments to support your claim. Probabilities: [0.5, 0.5]
---------------------------------------------
Debater B: Debater B: Thank you, Judge. I would like to provide further evidence to support my claim that Elsby is a rural and old-fashioned area. In the story, Elsby is described as a small town with yellow brick buildings and a stone lintel above the door of the Elsby Municipal Police. These details suggest a quaint and traditional setting, characteristic of a rural and old-fashioned area. Additionally, the mention of Bram's house being located in the isolated countryside further supports

Debater A: Debater A: I understand Debater B's argument about Elsby being a rural and old-fashioned area based on the description of the town and Bram's house in the isolated countryside. However, I would like to point out that the description of the Elsby Commercial Hotel as "run-down" and the appearance of the heavy man at the Elsby Municipal Police as having a "creased face and thick gray hair" suggest a more run-down and dirty atmosphere in the town.
---------------------------------------------
Judge: <CONTINUE> Thank you both for your additional arguments. Debater B has provided evidence that suggests Elsby is a rural and old-fashioned area based on the description of the town, the Elsby Municipal Police, and Bram's house in the isolated countryside. Debater A acknowledges Debater B's argument but maintains that the description of the Elsby Commercial Hotel and the appearance of the heavy man at the Elsby Municipal Police support the claim that Elsby is run-down and dirty.

Debater A, can you address Debater B's evidence regarding the description of the town, the Elsby Municipal Police, and Bram's house? Is there any additional evidence or counter-arguments you would like to provide? Debater B, do you have any response to Debater A's counter-arguments? Please provide any further evidence or counter-arguments to support your claim. Probabilities: [0.5, 0.5]

While it is true that the description of the Elsby Commercial Hotel and the appearance of the heavy man at the Elsby Municipal Police may suggest a run-down and dirty atmosphere, it does not necessarily negate the evidence I provided for Elsby being a rural and old-fashioned area.

Debater A: Debater A: Thank you, Judge. I understand Debater B's response, but I still maintain that the evidence provided does not necessarily support the claim that Elsby is a rural and old-fashioned area. While the description of the Elsby Commercial Hotel and the appearance of the heavy man at the Elsby Municipal Police may suggest a run-down and dirty atmosphere, it does not necessarily represent the entire town.

These descriptions could be isolated incidents rather than indicative of the overall state of Elsby. Additionally, the evidence I provided earlier, such as the mention of Elsby being a small town
---------------------------------------------
Judge: <VOTING> Thank you both for your final arguments. Debater A maintains that the evidence provided does not necessarily support the claim that Elsby is a run-down and dirty area, and that the descriptions of the Elsby Commercial Hotel and the appearance of the heavy man at the Elsby Municipal Police may be isolated incidents rather than indicative of the overall state of the town. Debater B acknowledges Debater A's response but argues that the evidence provided, such as the description of the town and the Elsby Municipal Police, supports the claim that Elsby is a rural and old-fashioned area.

After carefully considering the arguments and evidence presented by both debaters, I find Debater B's argument more convincing. The description of the town as a small, isolated countryside with yellow brick buildings and a stone lintel above the door of the Elsby Municipal Police suggests a quaint and traditional setting, characteristic of a rural and old-fashioned area. While the description of the Elsby Commercial Hotel and the appearance of the heavy man at the Elsby Municipal Police may suggest a run-down and dirty atmosphere, they do not necessarily represent the entire town.

Therefore, I assign the following probabilities: [0.4, 0.6], with 0.4 corresponding to the probability that Debater A's answer is correct (run-down and dirty) and 0.6 corresponding to the probability that Debater B's answer is correct (rural and old-fashioned).
