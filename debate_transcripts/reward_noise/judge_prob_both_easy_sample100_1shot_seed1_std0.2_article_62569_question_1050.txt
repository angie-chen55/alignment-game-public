The Monster Maker
By RAY BRADBURY
"Get Gunther," the official orders read. It

 was to laugh! For Click and Irish were

 marooned on the pirate's asteroid—their only

 weapons a single gun and a news-reel camera.

Suddenly, it was there. There wasn't time to blink or speak or get
 scared. Click Hathaway's camera was loaded and he stood there listening
 to it rack-spin film between his fingers, and he knew he was getting a
 damned sweet picture of everything that was happening.


 The picture of Marnagan hunched huge over the control-console,
 wrenching levers, jamming studs with freckled fists. And out in the
 dark of the fore-part there was space and a star-sprinkling and this
 meteor coming like blazing fury.


 Click Hathaway felt the ship move under him like a sensitive animal's
 skin. And then the meteor hit. It made a spiked fist and knocked the
 rear-jets flat, and the ship spun like a cosmic merry-go-round.


 There was plenty of noise. Too damned much. Hathaway only knew he was
 picked up and hurled against a lever-bank, and that Marnagan wasn't
 long in following, swearing loud words. Click remembered hanging on to
 his camera and gritting to keep holding it. What a sweet shot that had
 been of the meteor! A sweeter one still of Marnagan beating hell out of
 the controls and keeping his words to himself until just now.


 It got quiet. It got so quiet you could almost hear the asteroids
 rushing up, cold, blue and hard. You could hear your heart kicking a
 tom-tom between your sick stomach and your empty lungs.


 Stars, asteroids revolved. Click grabbed Marnagan because he was the
 nearest thing, and held on. You came hunting for a space-raider and you
 ended up cradled in a slab-sized Irishman's arms, diving at a hunk of
 metal death. What a fade-out!


 "Irish!" he heard himself say. "Is this IT?"


 "Is this
what
?" yelled Marnagan inside his helmet.


 "Is this where the Big Producer yells CUT!?"


 Marnagan fumed. "I'll die when I'm damned good and ready. And when I'm
 ready I'll inform you and you can picture me profile for Cosmic Films!"


 They both waited, thrust against the shipside and held by a hand of
 gravity; listening to each other's breathing hard in the earphones.


 The ship struck, once. Bouncing, it struck again. It turned end over
 and stopped. Hathaway felt himself grabbed; he and Marnagan rattled
 around—human dice in a croupier's cup. The shell of the ship burst,
 air and energy flung out.


 Hathaway screamed the air out of his lungs, but his brain was thinking
 quick crazy, unimportant things. The best scenes in life never reach
 film, or an audience. Like this one, dammit! Like
this
one! His
 brain spun, racketing like the instantaneous, flicking motions of his
 camera.
Silence came and engulfed all the noise, ate it up and swallowed it.
 Hathaway shook his head, instinctively grabbed at the camera locked
 to his mid-belt. There was nothing but stars, twisted wreckage, cold
 that pierced through his vac-suit, and silence. He wriggled out of the
 wreckage into that silence.


 He didn't know what he was doing until he found the camera in his
 fingers as if it had grown there when he was born. He stood there,
 thinking "Well, I'll at least have a few good scenes on film. I'll—"


 A hunk of metal teetered, fell with a crash. Marnagan elevated seven
 feet of bellowing manhood from the wreck.


 "Hold it!" cracked Hathaway's high voice. Marnagan froze. The camera
 whirred. "Low angle shot; Interplanetary Patrolman emerges unscathed
 from asteroid crackup. Swell stuff. I'll get a raise for this!"


 "From the toe of me boot!" snarled Marnagan brusquely. Oxen shoulders
 flexed inside his vac-suit. "I might've died in there, and you nursin'
 that film-contraption!"


 Hathaway felt funny inside, suddenly. "I never thought of that.
 Marnagan die? I just took it for granted you'd come through. You always
 have. Funny, but you don't think about dying. You try not to." Hathaway
 stared at his gloved hand, but the gloving was so thick and heavy he
 couldn't tell if it was shaking. Muscles in his bony face went down,
 pale. "Where are we?"


 "A million miles from nobody."


 They stood in the middle of a pocked, time-eroded meteor plain that
 stretched off, dipping down into silent indigo and a rash of stars.
 Overhead, the sun poised; black and stars all around it, making it look
 sick.


 "If we walk in opposite directions, Click Hathaway, we'd be shaking
 hands the other side of this rock in two hours." Marnagan shook his mop
 of dusty red hair. "And I promised the boys at Luna Base this time I'd
 capture that Gunther lad!"


 His voice stopped and the silence spoke.


 Hathaway felt his heart pumping slow, hot pumps of blood. "I checked
 my oxygen, Irish. Sixty minutes of breathing left."


 The silence punctuated that sentence, too. Upon the sharp meteoric
 rocks Hathaway saw the tangled insides of the radio, the food supply
 mashed and scattered. They were lucky to have escaped. Or
was
suffocation a better death...?
Sixty minutes.
They stood and looked at one another.


 "Damn that meteor!" said Marnagan, hotly.


 Hathaway got hold of an idea; remembering something. He said it out:
 "Somebody tossed that meteor, Irish. I took a picture of it, looked
 it right in the eye when it rolled at us, and it was poker-hot.
 Space-meteors are never hot and glowing. If it's proof you want, I've
 got it here, on film."


 Marnagan winced his freckled square of face. "It's not proof we need
 now, Click. Oxygen. And then
food
. And then some way back to Earth."


 Hathaway went on saying his thoughts: "This is Gunther's work. He's
 here somewhere, probably laughing his guts out at the job he did us.
 Oh, God, this would make great news-release stuff if we ever get back
 to Earth. I.P.'s Irish Marnagan, temporarily indisposed by a pirate
 whose dirty face has never been seen, Gunther by name, finally wins
 through to a triumphant finish. Photographed on the spot, in color, by
 yours truly, Click Hathaway. Cosmic Films, please notice."
They started walking, fast, over the pocked, rubbled plain toward a
 bony ridge of metal. They kept their eyes wide and awake. There wasn't
 much to see, but it was better than standing still, waiting.


 Marnagan said, "We're working on margin, and we got nothin' to sweat
 with except your suspicions about this not being an accident. We got
 fifty minutes to prove you're right. After that—right or wrong—you'll
 be Cosmic Films prettiest unmoving, unbreathin' genius. But talk all
 you like, Click. It's times like this when we all need words, any
 words, on our tongues. You got your camera and your scoop. Talk about
 it. As for me—" he twisted his glossy red face. "Keeping alive is me
 hobby. And this sort of two-bit death I did not order."


 Click nodded. "Gunther knows how you'd hate dying this way, Irish.
 It's irony clean through. That's probably why he planned the meteor and
 the crash this way."


 Marnagan said nothing, but his thick lips went down at the corners, far
 down, and the green eyes blazed.


 They stopped, together.


 "Oops!" Click said.


 "Hey!" Marnagan blinked. "Did you feel
that
?"


 Hathaway's body felt feathery, light as a whisper, boneless and
 limbless, suddenly. "Irish! We lost weight, coming over that ridge!"


 They ran back. "Let's try it again."


 They tried it. They scowled at each other. The same thing happened.
 "Gravity should not act this way, Click."


 "Are you telling me? It's man-made. Better than that—it's Gunther! No
 wonder we fell so fast—we were dragged down by a super-gravity set-up!
 Gunther'd do anything to—did I say
anything
?"


 Hathaway leaped backward in reaction. His eyes widened and his hand
 came up, jabbing. Over a hill-ridge swarmed a brew of unbelievable
 horrors. Progeny from Frankenstein's ARK. Immense crimson beasts with
 numerous legs and gnashing mandibles, brown-black creatures, some
 tubular and fat, others like thin white poisonous whips slashing along
 in the air. Fangs caught starlight white on them.


 Hathaway yelled and ran, Marnagan at his heels, lumbering. Sweat broke
 cold on his body. The immense things rolled, slithered and squirmed
 after him. A blast of light. Marnagan, firing his proton-gun. Then, in
 Click's ears, the Irishman's incredulous bellow. The gun didn't hurt
 the creatures at all.


 "Irish!" Hathaway flung himself over the ridge, slid down an incline
 toward the mouth a small cave. "This way, fella!"


 Hathaway made it first, Marnagan bellowing just behind him. "They're
 too big; they can't get us in here!" Click's voice gasped it out,
 as Marnagan squeezed his two-hundred-fifty pounds beside him.
 Instinctively, Hathaway added, "Asteroid monsters! My camera! What a
 scene!"


 "Damn your damn camera!" yelled Marnagan. "They might come in!"


 "Use your gun."


 "They got impervious hides. No use. Gahh! And that was a pretty chase,
 eh, Click?"


 "Yeah. Sure.
You
enjoyed it, every moment of it."


 "I did that." Irish grinned, showing white uneven teeth. "Now, what
 will we be doing with these uninvited guests at our door?"


 "Let me think—"


 "Lots of time, little man. Forty more minutes of air, to be exact."
They sat, staring at the monsters for about a minute. Hathaway felt
 funny about something; didn't know what. Something about these monsters
 and Gunther and—


 "Which one will you be having?" asked Irish, casually. "A red one or a
 blue one?"


 Hathaway laughed nervously. "A pink one with yellow ruffles—Good God,
 now you've got
me
doing it. Joking in the face of death."


 "Me father taught me; keep laughing and you'll have Irish luck."


 That didn't please the photographer. "I'm an Anglo-Swede," he pointed
 out.


 Marnagan shifted uneasily. "Here, now. You're doing nothing but
 sitting, looking like a little boy locked in a bedroom closet, so take
 me a profile shot of the beasties and myself."


 Hathaway petted his camera reluctantly. "What in hell's the use? All
 this swell film shot. Nobody'll ever see it."


 "Then," retorted Marnagan, "we'll develop it for our own benefit; while
 waitin' for the U.S. Cavalry to come riding over the hill to our
 rescue!"


 Hathaway snorted. "U.S. Cavalry."


 Marnagan raised his proton-gun dramatically. "Snap me this pose," he
 said. "I paid your salary to trot along, photographing, we hoped,
 my capture of Gunther, now the least you can do is record peace
 negotiations betwixt me and these pixies."


 Marnagan wasn't fooling anybody. Hathaway knew the superficial palaver
 for nothing but a covering over the fast, furious thinking running
 around in that red-cropped skull. Hathaway played the palaver, too, but
 his mind was whirring faster than his camera as he spun a picture of
 Marnagan standing there with a useless gun pointed at the animals.


 Montage. Marnagan sitting, chatting at the monsters. Marnagan smiling
 for the camera. Marnagan in profile. Marnagan looking grim, without
 much effort, for the camera. And then, a closeup of the thrashing death
 wall that holed them in. Click took them all, those shots, not saying
 anything. Nobody fooled nobody with this act. Death was near and they
 had sweaty faces, dry mouths and frozen guts.


 When Click finished filming, Irish sat down to save oxygen, and used it
 up arguing about Gunther. Click came back at him:


 "Gunther drew us down here, sure as Ceres! That gravity change we felt
 back on that ridge, Irish; that proves it. Gunther's short on men. So,
 what's he do; he builds an asteroid-base, and drags ships down. Space
 war isn't perfect yet, guns don't prime true in space, trajectory
 is lousy over long distances. So what's the best weapon, which
 dispenses with losing valuable, rare ships and a small bunch of men?
 Super-gravity and a couple of well-tossed meteors. Saves all around.
 It's a good front, this damned iron pebble. From it, Gunther strikes
 unseen; ships simply crash, that's all. A subtle hand, with all aces."


 Marnagan rumbled. "Where is the dirty son, then!"


 "He didn't have to appear, Irish. He sent—them." Hathaway nodded at
 the beasts. "People crashing here die from air-lack, no food, or from
 wounds caused at the crackup. If they survive all that—the animals
 tend to them. It all looks like Nature was responsible. See how subtle
 his attack is? Looks like accidental death instead of murder, if the
 Patrol happens to land and finds us. No reason for undue investigation,
 then."


 "I don't see no Base around."
Click shrugged. "Still doubt it? Okay. Look." He tapped his camera and
 a spool popped out onto his gloved palm. Holding it up, he stripped
 it out to its full twenty inch length, held it to the light while it
 developed, smiling. It was one of his best inventions. Self-developing
 film. The first light struck film-surface, destroyed one chemical,
 leaving imprints; the second exposure simply hardened, secured the
 impressions. Quick stuff.


 Inserting the film-tongue into a micro-viewer in the camera's base,
 Click handed the whole thing over. "Look."


 Marnagan put the viewer up against the helmet glass, squinted. "Ah,
 Click. Now, now. This is one lousy film you invented."


 "Huh?"


 "It's a strange process'll develop my picture and ignore the asteroid
 monsters complete."


 "What!"


 Hathaway grabbed the camera, gasped, squinted, and gasped again:
 Pictures in montage; Marnagan sitting down, chatting conversationally
 with
nothing
; Marnagan shooting his gun at
nothing
; Marnagan
 pretending to be happy in front of
nothing
.


 Then, closeup—of—NOTHING!


 The monsters had failed to image the film. Marnagan was there, his hair
 like a red banner, his freckled face with the blue eyes bright in it.
 Maybe—


 Hathaway said it, loud: "Irish! Irish! I think I see a way out of this
 mess! Here—"


 He elucidated it over and over again to the Patrolman. About the film,
 the beasts, and how the film couldn't be wrong. If the film said the
 monsters weren't there, they weren't there.


 "Yeah," said Marnagan. "But step outside this cave—"


 "If my theory is correct I'll do it, unafraid," said Click.


 Marnagan scowled. "You sure them beasts don't radiate ultra-violet or
 infra-red or something that won't come out on film?"


 "Nuts! Any color
we
see, the camera sees. We've been fooled."


 "Hey, where
you
going?" Marnagan blocked Hathaway as the smaller man
 tried pushing past him.


 "Get out of the way," said Hathaway.


 Marnagan put his big fists on his hips. "If anyone is going anywhere,
 it'll be me does the going."


 "I can't let you do that, Irish."


 "Why not?"


 "You'd be going on my say-so."


 "Ain't your say-so good enough for me?"


 "Yes. Sure. Of course. I guess—"


 "If you say them animals ain't there, that's all I need. Now, stand
 aside, you film-developing flea, and let an Irishman settle their
 bones." He took an unnecessary hitch in trousers that didn't exist
 except under an inch of porous metal plate. "Your express purpose on
 this voyage, Hathaway, is taking films to be used by the Patrol later
 for teaching Junior Patrolmen how to act in tough spots. First-hand
 education. Poke another spool of film in that contraption and give me
 profile a scan. This is lesson number seven: Daniel Walks Into The
 Lion's Den."


 "Irish, I—"


 "Shut up and load up."


 Hathaway nervously loaded the film-slot, raised it.


 "Ready, Click?"


 "I—I guess so," said Hathaway. "And remember, think it hard, Irish.
 Think it hard. There aren't any animals—"


 "Keep me in focus, lad."


 "All the way, Irish."


 "What do they say...? Oh, yeah. Action. Lights. Camera!"


 Marnagan held his gun out in front of him and still smiling took one,
 two, three, four steps out into the outside world. The monsters were
 waiting for him at the fifth step. Marnagan kept walking.


 Right out into the middle of them....
That was the sweetest shot Hathaway ever took. Marnagan and the
 monsters!


 Only now it was only Marnagan.


 No more monsters.


 Marnagan smiled a smile broader than his shoulders. "Hey, Click, look
 at me! I'm in one piece. Why, hell, the damned things turned tail and
 ran away!"


 "Ran, hell!" cried Hathaway, rushing out, his face flushed and
 animated. "They just plain vanished. They were only imaginative
 figments!"


 "And to think we let them hole us in that way, Click Hathaway, you
 coward!"


 "Smile when you say that, Irish."


 "Sure, and ain't I always smilin'? Ah, Click boy, are them tears in
 your sweet grey eyes?"


 "Damn," swore the photographer, embarrassedly. "Why don't they put
 window-wipers in these helmets?"


 "I'll take it up with the Board, lad."


 "Forget it. I was so blamed glad to see your homely carcass in one
 hunk, I couldn't help—Look, now, about Gunther. Those animals are part
 of his set-up. Explorers who land here inadvertently, are chased back
 into their ships, forced to take off. Tourists and the like. Nothing
 suspicious about animals. And if the tourists don't leave, the animals
 kill them."


 "Shaw, now. Those animals can't kill."


 "Think not, Mr. Marnagan? As long as we believed in them they could
 have frightened us to death, forced us, maybe, to commit suicide. If
 that isn't being dangerous—"


 The Irishman whistled.


 "But, we've got to
move
, Irish. We've got twenty minutes of oxygen.
 In that time we've got to trace those monsters to their source,
 Gunther's Base, fight our way in, and get fresh oxy-cannisters." Click
 attached his camera to his mid-belt. "Gunther probably thinks we're
 dead by now. Everyone else's been fooled by his playmates; they never
 had a chance to disbelieve them."


 "If it hadn't been for you taking them pictures, Click—"


 "Coupled with your damned stubborn attitude about the accident—" Click
 stopped and felt his insides turning to water. He shook his head and
 felt a film slip down over his eyes. He spread his legs out to steady
 himself, and swayed. "I—I don't think my oxygen is as full as yours.
 This excitement had me double-breathing and I feel sick."


 Marnagan's homely face grimaced in sympathy. "Hold tight, Click. The
 guy that invented these fish-bowls didn't provide for a sick stomach."


 "Hold tight, hell, let's move. We've got to find where those animals
 came from! And the only way to do that is to get the animals to come
 back!"


 "Come back? How?"


 "They're waiting, just outside the aura of our thoughts, and if we
 believe in them again, they'll return."


 Marnagan didn't like it. "Won't—won't they kill us—if they come—if
 we believe in 'em?"


 Hathaway shook a head that was tons heavy and weary. "Not if we believe
 in them to a
certain point
. Psychologically they can both be seen and
 felt. We only want to
see
them coming at us again."


 "
Do
we, now?"


 "With twenty minutes left, maybe less—"


 "All right, Click, let's bring 'em back. How do we do it?"


 Hathaway fought against the mist in his eyes. "Just think—I will see
 the monsters again. I will see them again and I will not feel them.
 Think it over and over."


 Marnagan's hulk stirred uneasily. "And—what if I forget to remember
 all that? What if I get excited...?"


 Hathaway didn't answer. But his eyes told the story by just looking at
 Irish.


 Marnagan cursed. "All right, lad. Let's have at it!"


 The monsters returned.
A soundless deluge of them, pouring over the rubbled horizon, swarming
 in malevolent anticipation about the two men.


 "This way, Irish. They come from this way! There's a focal point, a
 sending station for these telepathic brutes. Come on!"


 Hathaway sludged into the pressing tide of color, mouths, contorted
 faces, silvery fat bodies misting as he plowed through them.
Marnagan was making good progress ahead of Hathaway. But he stopped and
 raised his gun and made quick moves with it. "Click! This one here!
 It's real!" He fell back and something struck him down. His immense
 frame slammed against rock, noiselessly.


 Hathaway darted forward, flung his body over Marnagan's, covered the
 helmet glass with his hands, shouting:


 "Marnagan! Get a grip, dammit! It's not real—don't let it force into
 your mind! It's not real, I tell you!"


 "Click—" Marnagan's face was a bitter, tortured movement behind glass.
 "Click—" He was fighting hard. "I—I—sure now. Sure—" He smiled.
 "It—it's only a shanty fake!"


 "Keep saying it, Irish. Keep it up."


 Marnagan's thick lips opened. "It's only a fake," he said. And then,
 irritated, "Get the hell off me, Hathaway. Let me up to my feet!"


 Hathaway got up, shakily. The air in his helmet smelled stale, and
 little bubbles danced in his eyes. "Irish,
you
forget the monsters.
 Let me handle them, I know how. They might fool you again, you might
 forget."


 Marnagan showed his teeth. "Gah! Let a flea have all the fun? And
 besides, Click, I like to look at them. They're pretty."


 The outpour of animals came from a low lying mound a mile farther on.
 Evidently the telepathic source lay there. They approached it warily.


 "We'll be taking our chances on guard," hissed Irish. "I'll go ahead,
 draw their attention, maybe get captured. Then,
you
show up with
your
gun...."


 "I haven't got one."


 "We'll chance it, then. You stick here until I see what's ahead. They
 probably got scanners out. Let them see me—"


 And before Hathaway could object, Marnagan walked off. He walked about
 five hundred yards, bent down, applied his fingers to something, heaved
 up, and there was a door opening in the rock.


 His voice came back across the distance, into Click's earphones. "A
 door, an air-lock, Click. A tunnel leading down inside!"


 Then, Marnagan dropped into the tunnel, disappearing. Click heard the
 thud of his feet hitting the metal flooring.


 Click sucked in his breath, hard and fast.


 "All right, put 'em up!" a new harsh voice cried over a different
 radio. One of Gunther's guards.


 Three shots sizzled out, and Marnagan bellowed.


 The strange harsh voice said, "That's better. Don't try and pick that
 gun up now. Oh, so it's you. I thought Gunther had finished you off.
 How'd you get past the animals?"


 Click started running. He switched off his
sending
audio, kept his
receiving
on. Marnagan, weaponless.
One
guard. Click gasped. Things
 were getting dark. Had to have air. Air. Air. He ran and kept running
 and listening to Marnagan's lying voice:


 "I tied them pink elephants of Gunther's in neat alphabetical bundles
 and stacked them up to dry, ya louse!" Marnagan said. "But, damn you,
 they killed my partner before he had a chance!"


 The guard laughed.
The air-lock door was still wide open when Click reached it, his head
 swimming darkly, his lungs crammed with pain-fire and hell-rockets. He
 let himself down in, quiet and soft. He didn't have a weapon. He didn't
 have a weapon. Oh, damn, damn!


 A tunnel curved, ending in light, and two men silhouetted in that
 yellow glare. Marnagan, backed against a wall, his helmet cracked,
 air hissing slowly out of it, his face turning blue. And the guard, a
 proton gun extended stiffly before him, also in a vac-suit. The guard
 had his profile toward Hathaway, his lips twisting: "I think I'll let
 you stand right there and die," he said quietly. "That what Gunther
 wanted, anway. A nice sordid death."


 Hathaway took three strides, his hands out in front of him.


 "Don't move!" he snapped. "I've got a weapon stronger than yours. One
 twitch and I'll blast you and the whole damned wall out from behind
 you! Freeze!"


 The guard whirled. He widened his sharp eyes, and reluctantly, dropped
 his gun to the floor.


 "Get his gun, Irish."


 Marnagan made as if to move, crumpled clumsily forward.


 Hathaway ran in, snatched up the gun, smirked at the guard. "Thanks for
 posing," he said. "That shot will go down in film history for candid
 acting."


 "What!"


 "Ah: ah! Keep your place. I've got a real gun now. Where's the door
 leading into the Base?"


 The guard moved his head sullenly over his left shoulder.


 Click was afraid he would show his weak dizziness. He needed air.
 "Okay. Drag Marnagan with you, open the door and we'll have air. Double
 time! Double!"


 Ten minutes later, Marnagan and Hathaway, fresh tanks of oxygen on
 their backs, Marnagan in a fresh bulger and helmet, trussed the guard,
 hid him in a huge trash receptacle. "Where he belongs," observed Irish
 tersely.


 They found themselves in a complete inner world; an asteroid nothing
 more than a honey-comb fortress sliding through the void unchallenged.
 Perfect front for a raider who had little equipment and was
 short-handed of men. Gunther simply waited for specific cargo ships to
 rocket by, pulled them or knocked them down and swarmed over them for
 cargo. The animals served simply to insure against suspicion and the
 swarms of tourists that filled the void these days. Small fry weren't
 wanted. They were scared off.


 The telepathic sending station for the animals was a great bank of
 intricate, glittering machine, through which strips of colored film
 with images slid into slots and machine mouths that translated them
 into thought-emanations. A damned neat piece of genius.


 "So here we are, still not much better off than we were," growled
 Irish. "We haven't a ship or a space-radio, and more guards'll turn
 up any moment. You think we could refocus this doohingey, project the
 monsters inside the asteroid to fool the pirates themselves?"


 "What good would that do?" Hathaway gnawed his lip. "They wouldn't fool
 the engineers who created them, you nut."


 Marnagan exhaled disgustedly. "Ah, if only the U.S. Cavalry would come
 riding over the hill—"
"Irish!" Hathaway snapped that, his face lighting up. "Irish. The U.S.
 Cavalry it is!" His eyes darted over the machines. "Here. Help me.
 We'll stage everything on the most colossal raid of the century."


 Marnagan winced. "You breathing oxygen or whiskey?"


 "There's only one stipulation I make, Irish. I want a complete picture
 of Marnagan capturing Raider's Base. I want a picture of Gunther's face
 when you do it. Snap it, now, we've got rush work to do. How good an
 actor are you?"


 "That's a silly question."


 "You only have to do three things. Walk with your gun out in front of
 you, firing. That's number one. Number two is to clutch at your heart
 and fall down dead. Number three is to clutch at your side, fall down
 and twitch on the ground. Is that clear?"


 "Clear as the Coal Sack Nebula...."


 An hour later Hathaway trudged down a passageway that led out into a
 sort of city street inside the asteroid. There were about six streets,
 lined with cube houses in yellow metal, ending near Hathaway in a
 wide, green-lawned Plaza.


 Hathaway, weaponless, idly carrying his camera in one hand, walked
 across the Plaza as if he owned it. He was heading for a building that
 was pretentious enough to be Gunther's quarters.


 He got halfway there when he felt a gun in his back.


 He didn't resist. They took him straight ahead to his destination and
 pushed him into a room where Gunther sat.


 Hathaway looked at him. "So you're Gunther?" he said, calmly. The
 pirate was incredibly old, his bulging forehead stood out over sunken,
 questioningly dark eyes, and his scrawny body was lost in folds of
 metal-link cloth. He glanced up from a paper-file, surprised. Before he
 could speak, Hathaway said:


 "Everything's over with, Mr. Gunther. The Patrol is in the city now and
 we're capturing your Base. Don't try to fight. We've a thousand men
 against your eighty-five."


 Gunther sat there, blinking at Hathaway, not moving. His thin hands
 twitched in his lap. "You are bluffing," he said, finally, with a firm
 directness. "A ship hasn't landed here for an hour. Your ship was the
 last. Two people were on it. The last I saw of them they were being
 pursued to the death by the Beasts. One of you escaped, it seemed."


 "Both. The other guy went after the Patrol."


 "Impossible!"


 "I can't respect your opinion, Mr. Gunther."


 A shouting rose from the Plaza. About fifty of Gunther's men, lounging
 on carved benches during their time-off, stirred to their feet and
 started yelling. Gunther turned slowly to the huge window in one side
 of his office. He stared, hard.


 The Patrol was coming!


 Across the Plaza, marching quietly and decisively, came the Patrol.
 Five hundred Patrolmen in one long, incredible line, carrying paralysis
 guns with them in their tight hands.


 Gunther babbled like a child, his voice a shrill dagger in the air.
 "Get out there, you men! Throw them back! We're outnumbered!"


 Guns flared. But the Patrol came on. Gunther's men didn't run, Hathaway
 had to credit them on that. They took it, standing.


 Hathaway chuckled inside, deep. What a sweet, sweet shot this was.
 His camera whirred, clicked and whirred again. Nobody stopped him
 from filming it. Everything was too wild, hot and angry. Gunther was
 throwing a fit, still seated at his desk, unable to move because of his
 fragile, bony legs and their atrophied state.


 Some of the Patrol were killed. Hathaway chuckled again as he saw three
 of the Patrolmen clutch at their hearts, crumple, lie on the ground and
 twitch. God, what photography!


 Gunther raged, and swept a small pistol from his linked corselet. He
 fired wildly until Hathaway hit him over the head with a paper-weight.
 Then Hathaway took a picture of Gunther slumped at his desk, the chaos
 taking place immediately outside his window.


 The pirates broke and fled, those that were left. A mere handful. And
 out of the chaos came Marnagan's voice, "Here!"
