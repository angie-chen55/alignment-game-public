Moran cut apart the yard-long monstrosity with a slash of flame.
 The thing presumably died, but it continued to writhe senselessly.
 He turned to see other horrors crawling toward him. Then he knew he
 was being marooned on a planet of endless terrors.
Moran, naturally, did not mean to help in the carrying out of the plans
 which would mean his destruction one way or another. The plans were
 thrashed out very painstakingly, in formal conference on the space-yacht
Nadine
, with Moran present and allowed to take part in the discussion.
 From the viewpoint of the
Nadine's
ship's company, it was simply
 necessary to get rid of Moran. In their predicament he might have come
 to the same conclusion; but he was not at all enthusiastic about their
 decision. He would die of it.


 The
Nadine
was out of overdrive and all the uncountable suns of the
 galaxy shone steadily, remotely, as infinitesimal specks of light of
 every color of the rainbow. Two hours since, the sun of this solar
 system had been a vast glaring disk off to port, with streamers and
 prominences erupting about its edges. Now it lay astern, and Moran
 could see the planet that had been chosen for his marooning. It was a
 cloudy world. There were some dim markings near one lighted limb, but
 nowhere else. There was an ice-cap in view. The rest was—clouds.
The ice-cap, by its existence and circular shape, proved that the planet
 rotated at a not unreasonable rate. The fact that it was water-ice told
 much. A water-ice ice-cap said that there were no poisonous gases in the
 planet's atmosphere. Sulfur dioxide or chlorine, for example, would not
 allow the formation of water-ice. It would have to be sulphuric-acid or
 hydrochloric-acid ice. But the ice-cap was simple snow. Its size, too,
 told about temperature-distribution on the planet. A large cap would
 have meant a large area with arctic and sub-arctic temperatures, with
 small temperate and tropical climate-belts. A small one like this meant
 wide tropical and sub-tropical zones. The fact was verified by the
 thick, dense cloud-masses which covered most of the surface,—all the
 surface, in fact, outside the ice-cap. But since there were ice-caps
 there would be temperate regions. In short, the ice-cap proved that a
 man could endure the air and temperature conditions he would find.
Moran observed these things from the control-room of the
Nadine
, then
 approaching the world on planetary drive. He was to be left here, with
 no reason ever to expect rescue. Two of the
Nadine's
four-man crew
 watched out the same ports as the planet seemed to approach. Burleigh
 said encouragingly;


 "It doesn't look too bad, Moran!"


 Moran disagreed, but he did not answer. He cocked an ear instead. He
 heard something. It was a thin, wabbling, keening whine. No natural
 radiation sounds like that. Moran nodded toward the all-band speaker.


 "Do you hear what I do?" he asked sardonically.


 Burleigh listened. A distinctly artificial signal came out of the
 speaker. It wasn't a voice-signal. It wasn't an identification beacon,
 such as are placed on certain worlds for the convenience of interstellar
 skippers who need to check their courses on extremely long runs. This
 was something else.


 Burleigh said:


 "Hm ... Call the others, Harper."


 Harper, prudently with him in the control-room, put his head into the
 passage leading away. He called. But Moran observed with grudging
 respect that he didn't give him a chance to do anything drastic. These
 people on the
Nadine
were capable. They'd managed to recapture the
Nadine
from him, but they were matter-of-fact about it. They didn't
 seem to resent what he'd tried to do, or that he'd brought them an
 indefinite distance in an indefinite direction from their last
 landing-point, and they had still to re-locate themselves.
They'd been on Coryus Three and they'd gotten departure clearance from
 its space-port. With clearance-papers in order, they could land
 unquestioned at any other space-port and take off again—provided the
 other space-port was one they had clearance for. Without rigid control
 of space-travel, any criminal anywhere could escape the consequences of
 any crime simply by buying a ticket to another world. Moran couldn't
 have bought a ticket, but he'd tried to get off the planet Coryus on the
Nadine
. The trouble was that the
Nadine
had clearance papers
 covering five persons aboard—four men and a girl Carol. Moran made six.
 Wherever the yacht landed, such a disparity between its documents and
 its crew would spark an investigation. A lengthy, incredibly minute
 investigation. Moran, at least, would be picked out as a fugitive from
 Coryus Three. The others were fugitives too, from some unnamed world
 Moran did not know. They might be sent back where they came from. In
 effect, with six people on board instead of five, the
Nadine
could not
 land anywhere for supplies. With five on board, as her papers declared,
 she could. And Moran was the extra man whose presence would rouse
 space-port officials' suspicion of the rest. So he had to be dumped.


 He couldn't blame them. He'd made another difficulty, too. Blaster in
 hand, he'd made the
Nadine
take off from Coryus III with a trip-tape
 picked at random for guidance. But the trip-tape had been computed for
 another starting-point, and when the yacht came out of overdrive it was
 because the drive had been dismantled in the engine-room. So the ship's
 location was in doubt. It could have travelled at almost any speed in
 practically any direction for a length of time that was at least
 indefinite. A liner could re-locate itself without trouble. It had
 elaborate observational equipment and tri-di star-charts. But smaller
 craft had to depend on the Galactic Directory. The process would be to
 find a planet and check its climate and relationship to other planets,
 and its flora and fauna against descriptions in the Directory. That was
 the way to find out where one was, when one's position became doubtful.
 The
Nadine
needed to make a planet-fall for this.


 The rest of the ship's company came into the control-room. Burleigh
 waved his hand at the speaker.


 "Listen!"
They heard it. All of them. It was a trilling, whining sound among the
 innumerable random noises to be heard in supposedly empty space.


 "That's a marker," Carol announced. "I saw a costume-story tape once
 that had that sound in it. It marked a first-landing spot on some planet
 or other, so the people could find that spot again. It was supposed to
 be a long time ago, though."


 "It's weak," observed Burleigh. "We'll try answering it."


 Moran stirred, and he knew that every one of the others was conscious of
 the movement. But they didn't watch him suspiciously. They were alert by
 long habit. Burleigh said they'd been Underground people, fighting the
 government of their native world, and they'd gotten away to make it seem
 the revolt had collapsed. They'd go back later when they weren't
 expected, and start it up again. Moran considered the story probable.
 Only people accustomed to desperate actions would have remained so calm
 when Moran had used desperate measures against them.


 Burleigh picked up the transmitter-microphone.


 "Calling ground," he said briskly. "Calling ground! We pick up your
 signal. Please reply."


 He repeated the call, over and over and over. There was no answer.
 Cracklings and hissings came out of the speaker as before, and the thin
 and reedy wabbling whine continued. The
Nadine
went on toward the
 enlarging cloudy mass ahead.


 Burleigh said;


 "Well?"


 "I think," said Carol, "that we should land. People have been here. If
 they left a beacon, they may have left an identification of the planet.
 Then we'd know where we are and how to get to Loris."


 Burleigh nodded. The
Nadine
had cleared for Loris. That was where it
 should make its next landing. The little yacht went on. All five of its
 proper company watched as the planet's surface enlarged. The ice-cap
 went out of sight around the bulge of the globe, but no markings
 appeared. There were cloud-banks everywhere, probably low down in the
 atmosphere. The darker vague areas previously seen might have been
 highlands.


 "I think," said Carol, to Moran, "that if it's too tropical where this
 signal's coming from, we'll take you somewhere near enough to the
 ice-cap to have an endurable climate. I've been figuring on food, too.
 That will depend on where we are from Loris because we have to keep
 enough for ourselves. But we can spare some. We'll give you the
 emergency-kit, anyhow."
The emergency-kit contained antiseptics, seeds, and a weapon or two,
 with elaborate advice to castaways. If somebody were wrecked on an even
 possibly habitable planet, the especially developed seed-strains would
 provide food in a minimum of time. It was not an encouraging thought,
 though, and Moran grimaced.


 She hadn't said anything about being sorry that he had to be marooned.
 Maybe she was, but rebels learn to be practical or they don't live long.
 Moran wondered, momentarily, what sort of world they came from and why
 they had revolted, and what sort of set-back to the revolt had sent the
 five off in what they considered a strategic retreat but their
 government would think defeat. Moran's own situation was perfectly
 clear.


 He'd killed a man on Coryus III. His victim would not be mourned by
 anybody, and somebody formerly in very great danger would now be safe,
 which was the reason for what Moran had done. But the dead man had been
 very important, and the fact that Moran had forced him to fight and
 killed him in fair combat made no difference. Moran had needed to get
 off-planet, and fast. But space-travel regulations are especially
 designed to prevent such escapes.


 He'd made a pretty good try, at that. One of the controls on
 space-traffic required a ship on landing to deposit its fuel-block in
 the space-port's vaults. The fuel-block was not returned until clearance
 for departure had been granted. But Moran had waylaid the messenger
 carrying the
Nadine's
fuel-block back to that space-yacht. He'd
 knocked the messenger cold and presented himself at the yacht with the
 fuel. He was admitted. He put the block in the engine's gate. He duly
 took the plastic receipt-token the engine only then released, and he
 drew a blaster. He'd locked two of the
Nadine's
crew in the
 engine-room, rushed to the control-room without encountering the others,
 dogged the door shut, and threaded in the first trip-tape to come to
 hand. He punched the take-off button and only seconds later the
 overdrive. Then the yacht—and Moran—was away. But his present
 companions got the drive dismantled two days later and once the yacht
 was out of overdrive they efficiently gave him his choice of
 surrendering or else. He surrendered, stipulating that he wouldn't be
 landed back on Coryus; he still clung to hope of avoiding return—which
 was almost certain anyhow. Because nobody would want to go back to a
 planet from which they'd carried away a criminal, even though they'd
 done it unwillingly. Investigation of such a matter might last for
 months.


 Now the space-yacht moved toward a vast mass of fleecy whiteness without
 any visible features. Harper stayed with the direction-finder. From time
 to time he gave readings requiring minute changes of course. The
 wabbling, whining signal was louder now. It became louder than all the
 rest of the space-noises together.
The yacht touched atmosphere and Burleigh said;


 "Watch our height, Carol."


 She stood by the echometer. Sixty miles. Fifty. Thirty. A correction of
 course. Fifteen miles to surface below. Ten. Five. At twenty-five
 thousand feet there were clouds, which would be particles of ice so
 small that they floated even so high. Then clear air, then lower clouds,
 and lower ones still. It was not until six thousand feet above the
 surface that the planet-wide cloud-level seemed to begin. From there on
 down it was pure opacity. Anything could exist in that dense, almost
 palpable grayness. There could be jagged peaks.


 The
Nadine
went down and down. At fifteen hundred feet above the
 unseen surface, the clouds ended. Below, there was only haze. One could
 see the ground, at least, but there was no horizon. There was only an
 end to visibility. The yacht descended as if in the center of a sphere
 in which one could see clearly nearby, less clearly at a little
 distance, and not at all beyond a quarter-mile or so.


 There was a shaded, shadowless twilight under the cloud-bank. The ground
 looked like no ground ever seen before by anyone. Off to the right a
 rivulet ran between improbable-seeming banks. There were a few very
 small hills of most unlikely appearance. It was the ground, the matter
 on which one would walk, which was strangest. It had color, but the
 color was not green. Much of it was a pallid, dirty-yellowish white. But
 there were patches of blue, and curious veinings of black, and here and
 there were other colors, all of them unlike the normal color of
 vegetation on a planet with a sol-type sun.


 Harper spoke from the direction-finder;


 "The signal's coming from that mound, yonder."


 There was a hillock of elongated shape directly in line with the
Nadine's
course in descent. Except for the patches of color, it was
 the only considerable landmark within the half-mile circle in which
 anything could be seen at all.


 The
Nadine
checked her downward motion. Interplanetary drive is rugged
 and sure, but it does not respond to fine adjustment. Burleigh used
 rockets, issuing great bellowings of flame, to make actual contact. The
 yacht hovered, and as the rocket-flames diminished slowly she sat down
 with practically no impact at all. But around her there was a monstrous
 tumult of smoke and steam. When the rockets went off, she lay in a
 burned-out hollow some three or four feet deep with a bottom of solid
 stone. The walls of the hollow were black and scorched. It seemed that
 at some places they quivered persistently.


 There was silence in the control-room save for the whining noise which
 now was almost deafening. Harper snapped off the switch. Then there was
 true silence. The space-yacht had come to rest possibly a hundred yards
 from the mound which was the source of the space-signal. That mound
 shared the peculiarity of the ground as far as they could see through
 the haze. It was not vegetation in any ordinary sense. Certainly it was
 no mineral surface! The landing-pockets had burned away three or four
 feet of it, and the edge of the burned area smoked noisesomely, and
 somehow it looked as if it would reek. And there were places where it
 stirred.


 Burleigh blinked and stared. Then he reached up and flicked on the
 outside microphones. Instantly there was bedlam. If the landscape was
 strange, here, the sounds that came from it were unbelievable.
There were grunting noises. There were clickings, uncountable clickings
 that made a background for all the rest. There were discordant howls and
 honkings. From time to time some thing unknown made a cry that sounded
 very much like a small boy trailing a stick against a picket fence, only
 much louder. Something hooted, maintaining the noise for an impossibly
 long time. And persistently, sounding as if they came from far away,
 there were booming noises, unspeakably deep-bass, made by something
 alive. And something shrieked in lunatic fashion and something else
 still moaned from time to time with the volume of a steam-whistle....


 "This sounds and looks like a nice place to live," said Moran with fine
 irony.


 Burleigh did not answer. He turned down the outside sound.


 "What's that stuff there, the ground?" he demanded. "We burned it away
 in landing. I've seen something like it somewhere, but never taking the
 place of grass!"


 "That," said Moran as if brightly, "that's what I'm to make a garden in.
 Of evenings I'll stroll among my thrifty plantings and listen to the
 delightful sounds of nature."


 Burleigh scowled. Harper flicked off the direction-finder.


 "The signal still comes from that hillock yonder," he said with
 finality.


 Moran said bitingly;


 "That ain't no hillock, that's my home!"


 Then, instantly he'd said it, he recognized that it could be true. The
 mound was not a fold in the ground. It was not an up-cropping of the
 ash-covered stone on which the
Nadine
rested. The enigmatic,
 dirty-yellow-dirty-red-dirty-blue-and-dirty-black ground-cover hid
 something. It blurred the shape it covered, very much as enormous
 cobwebs made solid and opaque would have done. But when one looked
 carefully at the mound, there was a landing-fin sticking up toward the
 leaden skies. It was attached to a large cylindrical object of which the
 fore part was crushed in. The other landing-fins could be traced.


 "It's a ship," said Moran curtly. "It crash-landed and its crew set up a
 signal to call for help. None came, or they'd have turned the beacon
 off. Maybe they got the lifeboats to work and got away. Maybe they lived
 as I'm expected to live until they died as I'm expected to die."


 Burleigh said angrily;


 "You'd do what we are doing if you were in our shoes!"


 "Sure," said Moran, "but a man can gripe, can't he?"


 "You won't have to live here," said Burleigh. "We'll take you somewhere
 up by the ice-cap. As Carol said, we'll give you everything we can
 spare. And meanwhile we'll take a look at that wreck yonder. There might
 be an indication in it of what solar system this is. There could be
 something in it of use to you, too. You'd better come along when we
 explore."


 "Aye, aye, sir," said Moran with irony. "Very kind of you, sir. You'll
 go armed, sir?"


 Burleigh growled;


 "Naturally!"


 "Then since I can't be trusted with a weapon," said Moran, "I suggest
 that I take a torch. We may have to burn through that loathesome stuff
 to get in the ship."


 "Right," growled Burleigh again. "Brawn and Carol, you'll keep ship. The
 rest of us wear suits. We don't know what that stuff is outside."
Moran silently went to the space-suit rack and began to get into a
 suit. Modern space-suits weren't like the ancient crudities with bulging
 metal casings and enormous globular helmets. Non-stretch fabrics took
 the place of metal, and constant-volume joints were really practical
 nowadays. A man could move about in a late-model space-suit almost as
 easily as in ship-clothing. The others of the landing-party donned their
 special garments with the brisk absence of fumbling that these people
 displayed in every action.


 "If there's a lifeboat left," said Carol suddenly, "Moran might be able
 to do something with it."


 "Ah, yes!" said Moran. "It's very likely that the ship hit hard enough
 to kill everybody aboard, but not smash the boats!"


 "Somebody survived the crash," said Burleigh, "because they set up a
 beacon. I wouldn't count on a boat, Moran."


 "I don't!" snapped Moran.


 He flipped the fastener of his suit. He felt all the openings catch. He
 saw the others complete their equipment. They took arms. So far they had
 seen no moving thing outside, but arms were simple sanity on an unknown
 world. Moran, though, would not be permitted a weapon. He picked up a
 torch. They filed into the airlock. The inner door closed. The outer
 door opened. It was not necessary to check the air specifically. The
 suits would take care of that. Anyhow the ice-cap said there were no
 water-soluble gases in the atmosphere, and a gas can't be an active
 poison if it can't dissolve.


 They filed out of the airlock. They stood on ash-covered stone, only
 slightly eroded by the processes which made life possible on this
 planet. They looked dubiously at the scorched, indefinite substance
 which had been ground before the
Nadine
landed. Moran moved scornfully
 forward. He kicked at the burnt stuff. His foot went through the char.
 The hole exposed a cheesy mass of soft matter which seemed riddled with
 small holes.


 Something black came squirming frantically out of one of the openings.
 It was eight or ten inches long. It had a head, a thorax, and an
 abdomen. It had wing-cases. It had six legs. It toppled down to the
 stone on which the
Nadine
rested. Agitatedly, it spread its
 wing-covers and flew away, droning loudly. The four men heard the sound
 above even the monstrous cacophony of cries and boomings and grunts and
 squeaks which seemed to fill the air.


 "What the devil—."


 Moran kicked again. More holes. More openings. More small tunnels in the
 cheese-like, curd-like stuff. More black things squirming to view in
 obvious panic. They popped out everywhere. It was suddenly apparent
 that the top of the soil, here, was a thick and blanket-like sheet over
 the whitish stuff. The black creatures lived and thrived in tunnels
 under it.
Carol's voice came over the helmet-phones.


 "
They're—bugs!
" she said incredulously. "
They're beetles! They're
 twenty times the size of the beetles we humans have been carrying around
 the galaxy, but that's what they are!
"


 Moran grunted. Distastefully, he saw his predicament made worse. He knew
 what had happened here. He could begin to guess at other things to be
 discovered. It had not been practical for men to move onto new planets
 and subsist upon the flora and fauna they found there. On some new
 planets life had never gotten started. On such worlds a highly complex
 operation was necessary before humanity could move in. A complete
 ecological complex had to be built up; microbes to break down the rock
 for soil, bacteria to fix nitrogen to make the soil fertile; plants to
 grow in the new-made dirt and insects to fertilize the plants so they
 would multiply, and animals and birds to carry the seeds planet-wide. On
 most planets, to be sure, there were local, aboriginal plants and
 animals. But still terrestrial creatures had to be introduced if a
 colony was to feed itself. Alien plants did not supply satisfactory
 food. So an elaborate adaptation job had to be done on every planet
 before native and terrestrial living things settled down together. It
 wasn't impossible that the scuttling things were truly beetles, grown
 large and monstrous under the conditions of a new planet. And the
 ground....


 "This ground stuff," said Moran distastefully, "is yeast or some sort of
 toadstool growth. This is a seedling world. It didn't have any life on
 it, so somebody dumped germs and spores and bugs to make it ready for
 plants and animals eventually. But nobody's come back to finish up the
 job."


 Burleigh grunted a somehow surprised assent. But it wasn't surprising;
 not wholly so. Once one mentioned yeasts and toadstools and fungi
 generally, the weird landscape became less than incredible. But it
 remained actively unpleasant to think of being marooned on it.


 "Suppose we go look at the ship?" said Moran unpleasantly. "Maybe you
 can find out where you are, and I can find out what's ahead of me."


 He climbed up on the unscorched surface. It was elastic. The
 parchment-like top skin yielded. It was like walking on a mass of
 springs.


 "We'd better spread out," added Moran, "or else we'll break through that
 skin and be floundering in this mess."


 "I'm giving the orders, Moran!" said Burleigh shortly. "But what you say
 does make sense."
He and the others joined Moran on the yielding surface. Their footing
 was uncertain, as on a trampoline. They staggered. They moved toward the
 hillock which was a covered-over wrecked ship.


 The ground was not as level as it appeared from the
Nadine's
control-room. There were undulations. But they could not see more than a
 quarter-mile in any direction. Beyond that was mist. But Burleigh, at
 one end of the uneven line of advancing men, suddenly halted and stood
 staring down at something he had not seen before. The others halted.


 Something moved. It came out from behind a very minor spire of whitish
 stuff that looked like a dirty sheet stretched over a tall stone. The
 thing that appeared was very peculiar indeed. It was a—worm. But it was
 a foot thick and ten feet long, and it had a group of stumpy legs at its
 fore end—where there were eyes hidden behind bristling hair-like
 growths—and another set of feet at its tail end. It progressed sedately
 by reaching forward with its fore-part, securing a foothold, and then
 arching its middle portion like a cat arching its back, to bring its
 hind part forward. Then it reached forward again. It was of a dark olive
 color from one end to the other. Its manner of walking was insane but
 somehow sedate.


 Moran heard muffled noises in his helmet-phone as the others tried to
 speak. Carol's voice came anxiously;


 "
What's the matter? What do you see?
"


 Moran said with savage precision;


 "We're looking at an inch-worm, grown up like the beetles only more so.
 It's not an inch-worm any longer. It's a yard-worm." Then he said
 harshly to the men with him; "It's not a hunting creature on worlds
 where it's smaller. It's not likely to have turned deadly here. Come
 on!"


 He went forward over the singularly bouncy ground. The others followed.
 It was to be noted that Hallet the engineer, avoided the huge harmless
 creature more widely than most.
They reached the mound which was the ship. Moran unlimbered his torch.
 He said sardonically;


 "This ship won't do anybody any good. It's old-style. That thick belt
 around its middle was dropped a hundred years ago, and more." There was
 an abrupt thickening of the cylindrical hull at the middle. There was an
 equally abrupt thinning, again, toward the landing-fins. The sharpness
 of the change was blurred over by the revolting ground-stuff growing
 everywhere. "We're going to find that this wreck has been here a century
 at least!"


 Without orders, he turned on the torch. A four-foot flame of pure
 blue-white leaped out. He touched its tip to the fungoid soil. Steam
 leaped up. He used the flame like a gigantic scalpel, cutting a square a
 yard deep in the whitish stuff, and then cutting it across and across to
 destroy it. Thick fumes arose, and quiverings and shakings began. Black
 creatures in their labyrinths of tunnels began to panic. Off to the
 right the blanket-like surface ripped and they poured out. They scuttled
 crazily here and there. Some took to wing. By instinct the other
 men—the armed ones—moved back from the smoke. They wore space-helmets
 but they felt that there should be an intolerable smell.


 Moran slashed and slashed angrily with the big flame, cutting a way to
 the metal hull that had fallen here before his grandfather was born.
 Sometimes the flame cut across things that writhed, and he was sickened.
 But above all he raged because he was to be marooned here. He could not
 altogether blame the others. They couldn't land at any colonized world
 with him on board without his being detected as an extra member of the
 crew. His fate would then be sealed. But they also would be
 investigated. Official queries would go across this whole sector of the
 galaxy, naming five persons of such-and-such description and
 such-and-such fingerprints, voyaging in a space-yacht of such-and-such
 size and registration. The world they came from would claim them as
 fugitives. They would be returned to it. They'd be executed.


 Then Carol's voice came in his helmet-phone. She cried out;


 "
Look out! It's coming! Kill it! Kill it—.
"


 He heard blast-rifles firing. He heard Burleigh pant commands. He was on
 his way out of the hollow he'd carved when he heard Harper cry out
 horribly.


 He got clear of the newly burned-away stuff. There was still much smoke
 and stream. But he saw Harper. More, he saw the thing that had Harper.


 It occurred to him instantly that if Harper died, there would not be too
 many people on the
Nadine
. They need not maroon him. In fact, they
 wouldn't dare.


 A ship that came in to port with two few on board would be investigated
 as thoroughly as one that had too many. Perhaps more thoroughly. So if
 Harper were killed, Moran would be needed to take his place. He'd go on
 from here in the
Nadine
, necessarily accepted as a member of her crew.


 Then he rushed, the flame-torch making a roaring sound.
II.
They went back to the
Nadine
for weapons more adequate for
 encountering the local fauna when it was over. Blast-rifles were not
 effective against such creatures as these. Torches were contact weapons
 but they killed. Blast-rifles did not. And Harper needed to pull himself
 together again, too. Also, neither Moran nor any of the others wanted to
 go back to the still un-entered wreck while the skinny, somehow
 disgusting legs of the thing still kicked spasmodically—quite
 separate—on the whitish ground-stuff. Moran had disliked such creatures
 in miniature form on other worlds. Enlarged like this.


 It seemed insane that such creatures, even in miniature, should
 painstakingly be brought across light-years of space to the new worlds
 men settled on. But it had been found to be necessary. The ecological
 system in which human beings belonged had turned out to be infinitely
 complicated. It had turned out, in fact, to be the ecological system of
 Earth, and unless all parts of the complex were present, the total was
 subtly or glaringly wrong. So mankind distastefully ferried pests as
 well as useful creatures to its new worlds as they were made ready for
 settlement. Mosquitos throve on the inhabited globes of the Rim Stars.
 Roaches twitched nervous antennae on the settled planets of the
 Coal-sack. Dogs on Antares had fleas, and scratched their bites, and
 humanity spread through the galaxy with an attendant train of insects
 and annoyances. If they left their pests behind, the total system of
 checks and balances which make life practical would get lopsided. It
 would not maintain itself. The vagaries that could result were admirably
 illustrated in and on the landscape outside the
Nadine
. Something had
 been left out of the seeding of this planet. The element—which might be
 a bacterium or a virus or almost anything at all—the element that kept
 creatures at the size called "normal" was either missing or inoperable
 here. The results were not desirable.


Question: Which term does NOT describe Moran's tone toward the other five crew members?

Debater A: I claim the answer is vindictive
Debater B: I claim the answer is resigned
---------------------------------------------

Debater A: Resigned? No, Moran's tone was far from resigned. In fact, his attitude towards the other crew members was anything but resigned. He was bitter, resentful, and yes, vindictive. Throughout the story, Moran displayed his animosity towards the rest of the crew, particularly in his sarcastic remarks and biting comments. He resented being marooned and blamed them for his predicament. Moran's tone towards the other crew members was fueled by his frustration and anger, not
---------------------------------------------
Debater B: Debater B: I argue that the term "resigned" is not an accurate description of Moran's tone towards the other five crew members. While it is true that Moran may have accepted his fate to some extent, his attitude towards the rest of the crew was far from resigned. Moran was bitter and resentful towards them for their decision to maroon him on the planet. He felt betrayed and expressed his anger through sarcastic remarks and biting comments. For example, when Burleigh suggested taking

Judge: <CONTINUE> Both debaters have provided arguments and evidence to support their claims. A argues that Moran's tone was vindictive, while B argues that it was resigned. A provides examples of Moran's bitter and resentful attitude towards the other crew members, emphasizing his sarcastic remarks and biting comments. B acknowledges that Moran may have accepted his fate to some extent, but argues that his attitude was still far from resigned, pointing to Moran's bitterness and resentment towards the crew.
