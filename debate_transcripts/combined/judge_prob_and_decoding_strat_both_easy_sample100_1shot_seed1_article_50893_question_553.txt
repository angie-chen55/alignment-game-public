It has happened a hundred times in the long history
 
of Earth—and, sooner or later, will happen again!
Everyone—all the geologists, at any rate—had known about the Kiowa
 Fault for years. That was before there was anything very interesting
 to know about it. The first survey of Colorado traced its course north
 and south in the narrow valley of Kiowa Creek about twenty miles east
 of Denver; it extended south to the Arkansas River. And that was about
 all even the professionals were interested in knowing. There was never
 so much as a landslide to bring the Fault to the attention of the
 general public.


 It was still a matter of academic interest when in the late '40s
 geologists speculated on the relationship between the Kiowa Fault and
 the Conchas Fault farther south, in New Mexico, and which followed the
 Pecos as far south as Texas.


 Nor was there much in the papers a few years later when it was
 suggested that the Niobrara Fault (just inside and roughly parallel to
 the eastern border of Wyoming) was a northerly extension of the Kiowa.
 By the mid sixties it was definitely established that the three Faults
 were in fact a single line of fissure in the essential rock, stretching
 almost from the Canadian border well south of the New Mexico-Texas line.


 It is not really surprising that it took so long to figure out the
 connection. The population of the states affected was in places as
 low as five people per square mile! The land was so dry it seemed
 impossible that it could ever be used except for sheep-farming.


 It strikes us today as ironic that from the late '50s there was grave
 concern about the level of the water table throughout the entire area.
The even more ironic solution to the problem began in the summer of
 1973. It had been a particularly hot and dry August, and the Forestry
 Service was keeping an anxious eye out for the fires it knew it could
 expect. Dense smoke was reported rising above a virtually uninhabited
 area along Black Squirrel Creek, and a plane was sent out for a report.


 The report was—no fire at all. The rising cloud was not smoke, but
 dust. Thousands of cubic feet of dry earth rising lazily on the summer
 air. Rock slides, they guessed; certainly no fire. The Forestry Service
 had other worries at the moment, and filed the report.


 But after a week had gone by, the town of Edison, a good twenty miles
 away from the slides, was still complaining of the dust. Springs was
 going dry, too, apparently from underground disturbances. Not even in
 the Rockies could anyone remember a series of rock slides as bad as
 this.


 Newspapers in the mountain states gave it a few inches on the front
 page; anything is news in late August. And the geologists became
 interested. Seismologists were reporting unusual activity in the area,
 tremors too severe to be rock slides. Volcanic activity? Specifically,
 a dust volcano? Unusual, they knew, but right on the Kiowa Fault—could
 be.


 Labor Day crowds read the scientific conjectures with late summer
 lassitude. Sunday supplements ran four-color artists' conceptions of
 the possible volcano. "Only Active Volcano in U. S.?" demanded the
 headlines, and some papers even left off the question mark.


 It may seem odd that the simplest explanation was practically not
 mentioned. Only Joseph Schwartzberg, head geographer of the Department
 of the Interior, wondered if the disturbance might not be a settling
 of the Kiowa Fault. His suggestion was mentioned on page nine or ten
 of the Monday newspapers (page 27 of the New York
Times
). The idea
 was not nearly so exciting as a volcano, even a lava-less one, and you
 couldn't draw a very dramatic picture of it.


 To excuse the other geologists, it must be said that the Kiowa Fault
 had never acted up before. It never sidestepped, never jiggled,
 never, never produced the regular shows of its little sister out in
 California, which almost daily bounced San Francisco or Los Angeles, or
 some place in between. The dust volcano was on the face of it a more
 plausible theory.


 Still, it was only a theory. It had to be proved. As the tremors grew
 bigger, along with the affected area, as several towns including
 Edison were shaken to pieces by incredible earthquakes, whole bus- and
 plane-loads of geologists set out for Colorado, without even waiting
 for their university and government department to approve budgets.


 They found, of course, that Schwartzberg had been perfectly correct.
They found themselves on the scene of what was fast becoming the
 most violent and widespread earthquake North America—probably the
 world—has ever seen in historic times. To describe it in the simplest
 terms, land east of the Fault was settling, and at a precipitous rate.


 Rock scraped rock with a whining roar. Shuddery as a squeaky piece of
 chalk raked across a blackboard, the noise was deafening. The surfaces
 of the land east and west of the Fault seemed no longer to have any
 relation to each other. To the west, tortured rock reared into cliffs.
 East, where sharp reports and muffled wheezes told of continued
 buckling and dropping, the earth trembled downward. Atop the new
 cliffs, which seemed to grow by sudden inches from heaving rubble, dry
 earth fissured and trembled, sliding acres at a time to fall, smoking,
 into the bucking, heaving bottom of the depression.


 There the devastation was even more thorough, if less spectacular.
 Dry earth churned like mud, and rock shards weighing tons bumped and
 rolled about like pebbles as they shivered and cracked into pebbles
 themselves. "It looks like sand dancing in a child's sieve," said the
 normally impassive Schwartzberg in a nationwide broadcast from the
 scene of disaster. "No one here has ever seen anything like it." And
 the landslip was growing, north and south along the Fault.


 "Get out while you can," Schwartzberg urged the population of the
 affected area. "When it's over you can come back and pick up the
 pieces." But the band of scientists who had rallied to his leadership
 privately wondered if there would be any pieces.


 The Arkansas River, at Avondale and North Avondale, was sluggishly
 backing north into the deepening trough. At the rate things were going,
 there might be a new lake the entire length of El Paso and Pueblo
 Counties. And, warned Schwartzberg, this might only be the beginning.


 By 16 September the landslip had crept down the Huerfano River past
 Cedarwood. Avondale, North Avondale and Boone had totally disappeared.
 Land west of the Fault was holding firm, though Denver had recorded
 several small tremors; everywhere east of the Fault, to almost twenty
 miles away, the now-familiar lurch and steady fall had already sent
 several thousand Coloradans scurrying for safety.


 All mountain climbing was prohibited on the Eastern Slope because of
 the danger of rock slides from minor quakes. The geologists went home
 to wait.


 There wasn't much to wait for. The news got worse and worse. The Platte
 River, now, was creating a vast mud puddle where the town of Orchard
 had been. Just below Masters, Colorado, the river leaped 70-foot cliffs
 to add to the heaving chaos below. And the cliffs were higher every day
 as the land beneath them groaned downward in mile-square gulps.


 As the Fault moved north and south, new areas quivered into unwelcome
 life. Fields and whole mountainsides moved with deceptive sloth down,
 down. They danced "like sand in a sieve"; dry, they boiled into rubble.
 Telephone lines, railroad tracks, roads snapped and simply disappeared.
 Virtually all east-west land communication was suspended and the
 President declared a national emergency.
By 23 September the Fault was active well into Wyoming on the north,
 and rapidly approaching the border of New Mexico to the south.
 Trinchera and Branson were totally evacuated, but even so the over-all
 death toll had risen above 1,000.


 Away to the east the situation was quiet but even more ominous.
 Tremendous fissures opened up perpendicular to the Fault, and a general
 subsidence of the land was noticeable well into Kansas and Nebraska.
 The western borders of these states, and soon of the Dakotas and
 Oklahoma as well, were slowly sinking.


 On the actual scene of the disaster (or the
scenes
; it is impossible
 to speak of anything this size in the singular) there was a horrifying
 confusion. Prairie and hill cracked open under intolerable strains as
 the land shuddered downward in gasps and leaps. Springs burst to the
 surface in hot geysers and explosions of steam.


 The downtown section of North Platte, Nebraska, dropped eight feet,
 just like that, on the afternoon of 4 October. "We must remain calm,"
 declared the Governor of Nebraska. "We must sit this thing out. Be
 assured that everything possible is being done." But what could be
 done, with his state dropping straight down at a mean rate of a foot a
 day?


 The Fault nicked off the south-east corner of Montana. It worked its
 way north along the Little Missouri. South, it ripped past Roswell, New
 Mexico, and tore down the Pecos toward Texas. All the upper reaches of
 the Missouri were standing puddles by now, and the Red River west of
 Paris, Texas, had begun to run backward.


 Soon the Missouri began slowly slipping away westward over the slowly
 churning land. Abandoning its bed, the river spread uncertainly across
 farmland and prairie, becoming a sea of mud beneath the sharp new
 cliffs which rose in rending line, ever taller as the land continued to
 sink, almost from Canada to the Mexican border. There were virtually no
 floods, in the usual sense. The water moved too slowly, spread itself
 with no real direction or force. But the vast sheets of sluggish water
 and jelly-like mud formed death-traps for the countless refugees now
 streaming east.


 Perhaps the North Platte disaster had been more than anyone could take.
 193 people had died in that one cave-in. Certainly by 7 October it had
 to be officially admitted that there was an exodus of epic proportion.
 Nearly two million people were on the move, and the U. S. was faced
 with a gigantic wave of refugees. Rails, roads and air-lanes were
 jammed with terrified hordes who had left everything behind to crowd
 eastward.


 All through October hollow-eyed motorists flocked into Tulsa, Topeka,
 Omaha, Sioux Falls and Fargo. St. Louis was made distributing center
 for emergency squads which flew everywhere with milk for babies and
 dog food for evacuating pets. Gasoline trucks boomed west to meet the
 demand for gas, but once inside the "zone of terror," as the newspapers
 now called it, they found their route blocked by eastbound cars on the
 wrong side of the road. Shops left by their fleeing owners were looted
 by refugees from further west; an American Airlines plane was wrecked
 by a mob of would-be passengers in Bismarck, North Dakota. Federal and
 State troops were called out, but moving two million people was not to
 be done in an orderly way.


 And still the landslip grew larger. The new cliffs gleamed in the
 autumn sunshine, growing higher as the land beneath them continued its
 inexorable descent.


 On 21 October, at Lubbock, Texas, there was a noise variously described
 as a hollow roar, a shriek and a deep musical vibration like a church
 bell. It was simply the tortured rock of the substrata giving way. The
 second phase of the national disaster was beginning.
The noise traveled due east at better than 85 miles per hour. In its
 wake the earth to the north "just seemed to collapse on itself like
 a punctured balloon," read one newspaper report. "Like a cake that's
 failed," said a Texarkana housewife who fortunately lived a block
south
of Thayer Street, where the fissure raced through. There
 was a sigh and a great cloud of dust, and Oklahoma subsided at the
 astounding rate of about six feet per hour.


 At Biloxi, on the Gulf, there had been uneasy shufflings under foot all
 day. "Not tremors, exactly," said the captain of a fishing boat which
 was somehow to ride out the coming flood, "but like as if the land
 wanted to be somewhere else."


 Everyone in doomed Biloxi would have done well to have been somewhere
 else that evening. At approximately 8:30 p.m. the town shuddered,
 seemed to rise a little like the edge of a hall carpet caught in a
 draft, and sank. So did the entire Mississippi and Alabama coast, at
 about the same moment. The tidal wave which was to gouge the center
 from the U. S. marched on the land.
From the north shore of Lake Ponchartrain to the Appalachicola River
 in Florida, the Gulf coast simply disappeared. Gulfport, Biloxi,
 Mobile, Pensacola, Panama City: 200 miles of shoreline vanished, with
 over two and a half million people. An hour later a wall of water
 had swept over every town from Dothan, Alabama, to Bogalusa on the
 Louisiana-Mississippi border.


 "We must keep panic from our minds," said the Governor of Alabama in a
 radio message delivered from a hastily arranged all-station hookup. "We
 of the gallant southland have faced and withstood invasion before."
 Then, as ominous creakings and groanings of the earth announced the
 approach of the tidal wave, he flew out of Montgomery half an hour
 before the town disappeared forever.


 One head of the wave plunged north, eventually to spend itself in
 the hills south of Birmingham. The main sweep followed the lowest
 land. Reaching west, it swallowed Vicksburg and nicked the corner of
 Louisiana. The whole of East Carroll Parish was scoured from the map.


 The Mississippi River now ended at about Eudora, Arkansas, and minute
 by minute the advancing flood bit away miles of river bed, swelling
 north. Chicot, Jennie, Lake Village, Arkansas City, Snow Lake, Elaine,
 Helena and Memphis felt the tremors. The tormented city shuddered
 through the night. The earth continued its descent, eventually tipping
 2-1/2 degrees down to the west. The "Memphis Tilt" is today one of
 the unique and charming characteristics of the gracious Old Town, but
 during the night of panic Memphis residents were sure they were doomed.
South and west the waters carved deeply into Arkansas and Oklahoma.
 By morning it was plain that all of Arkansas was going under. Waves
 advanced on Little Rock at almost 100 miles an hour, new crests
 forming, overtopping the wave's leading edge as towns, hills and the
 thirst of the soil temporarily broke the furious charge.


 Washington announced the official hope that the Ozarks would stop the
 wild gallop of the unleashed Gulf, for in northwest Arkansas the land
 rose to over 2,000 feet. But nothing could save Oklahoma. By noon the
 water reached clutching fingers around Mt. Scott and Elk Mountain,
 deluging Hobart and almost all of Greer County.


 Despite hopeful announcements that the wave was slowing, had virtually
 stopped after inundating Oklahoma City, was being swallowed up in the
 desert near Amarillo, the wall of water continued its advance. For the
 land was still sinking, and the floods were constantly replenished from
 the Gulf. Schwartzberg and his geologists advised the utmost haste in
 evacuating the entire area between Colorado and Missouri, from Texas to
 North Dakota.


 Lubbock, Texas, went under. On a curling reflex the tidal wave blotted
 out Sweetwater and Big Spring. The Texas panhandle disappeared in one
 great swirl.


 Whirlpools opened. A great welter of smashed wood and human debris was
 sucked under, vomited up and pounded to pieces. Gulf-water crashed on
 the cliffs of New Mexico and fell back on itself in foam. Would-be
 rescuers on the cliffs along what had been the west bank of the Pecos
 River afterwards recalled the hiss and scream like tearing silk as
 the water broke furiously on the newly exposed rock. It was the most
 terrible sound they had ever heard.


 "We couldn't hear any shouts, of course, not that far away and with all
 the noise," said Dan Weaver, Mayor of Carlsbad. "But we knew there
 were people down there. When the water hit the cliffs, it was like a
 collision between two solid bodies. We couldn't see for over an hour,
 because of the spray."
Salt spray.
The ocean had come to New Mexico.
The cliffs proved to be the only effective barrier against the westward
 march of the water, which turned north, gouging out lumps of rock and
 tumbling down blocks of earth onto its own back. In places scoops of
 granite came out like ice cream. The present fishing town of Rockport,
 Colorado, is built on a harbor created in such a way.


 The water had found its farthest westering. But still it poured north
 along the line of the original Fault. Irresistible fingers closed on
 Sterling, Colorado, on Sidney, Nebraska, on Hot Springs, South Dakota.
 The entire tier of states settled, from south to north, down to its
 eventual place of stability one thousand feet below the level of the
 new sea.


 Memphis was by now a seaport. The Ozarks, islands in a mad sea, formed
 precarious havens for half-drowned humanity. Waves bit off a corner of
 Missouri, flung themselves on Wichita. Topeka, Lawrence and Belleville
 were the last Kansas towns to disappear. The Governor of Kansas went
 down with his State.


 Daniel Bernd of Lincoln, Nebraska, was washed up half-drowned in a cove
 of the Wyoming cliffs, having been sucked from one end of vanished
 Nebraska to the other. Similar hair-breadth escapes were recounted on
 radio and television.


 Virtually the only people saved out of the entire population of Pierre,
 South Dakota were the six members of the Creeth family. Plucky Timothy
 Creeth carried and dragged his aged parents to the loft of their barn
 on the outskirts of town. His brother Geoffrey brought along the
 younger children and what provisions they could find—"Mostly a ham
 and about half a ton of vanilla cookies," he explained to his eventual
 rescuers. The barn, luckily collapsing in the vibrations as the waves
 bore down on them, became an ark in which they rode out the disaster.


 "We must of played cards for four days straight," recalled genial
 Mrs. Creeth when she afterwards appeared on a popular television
 spectacular. Her rural good-humor undamaged by an ordeal few women can
 ever have been called on to face, she added, "We sure wondered why
 flushes never came out right. Jimanettly, we'd left the king of hearts
 behind, in the rush!"


 But such lightheartedness and such happy endings were by no means
 typical. The world could only watch aghast as the water raced north
 under the shadow of the cliffs which occasionally crumbled, roaring,
 into the roaring waves. Day by day the relentless rush swallowed what
 had been dusty farmland, cities and towns.


 Some people were saved by the helicopters which flew mercy missions
 just ahead of the advancing waters. Some found safety in the peaks of
 western Nebraska and the Dakotas. But when the waters came to rest
 along what is roughly the present shoreline of our inland sea, it was
 estimated that over fourteen million people had lost their lives.


 No one could even estimate the damage to property; almost the entirety
 of eight states, and portions of twelve others, had simply vanished
 from the heart of the North American continent forever.
It was in such a cataclysmic birth that the now-peaceful Nebraska Sea
 came to America.


 Today, nearly one hundred years after the unprecedented—and happily
 unrepeated—disaster, it is hard to remember the terror and despair of
 those weeks in October and November, 1973. It is inconceivable to think
 of the United States without its beautiful and economically essential
 curve of interior ocean. Two-thirds as long as the Mediterranean,
 it graduates from the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico through the
 equally blue waves of the Mississippi Bight, becoming cooler and
 greener north and west of the pleasant fishing isles of the Ozark
 Archipelago, finally shading into the gray-green chop of the Gulf of
 Dakota.


 What would the United States have become without the 5600-mile
 coastline of our inland sea? It is only within the last twenty years
 that any but the topmost layer of water has cleared sufficiently
 to permit a really extensive fishing industry. Mud still held in
 suspension by the restless waves will not precipitate fully even in our
 lifetimes. Even so, the commercial fisheries of Missouri and Wyoming
 contribute no small part to the nation's economy.
Who can imagine what the middle west must have been like before the
 amelioration of climate brought about by the proximity of a warm sea?
 The now-temperate state of Minnesota (to say nothing of the submerged
 Dakotas) must have been Siberian. From contemporary accounts Missouri,
 our second California, was unbelievably muggy, almost uninhabitable
 during the summer months. Our climate today, from Ohio and North
 Carolina to the rich fields of New Mexico and the orchards of Montana,
 is directly ameliorated by the marine heart of the continent.
Who today could imagine the United States without the majestic
 sea-cliffs in stately parade from New Mexico to Montana? The beaches
 of Wyoming, the American Riviera, where fruit trees grow almost to the
 water's edge? Or incredible Colorado, where the morning skier is the
 afternoon bather, thanks to the monorail connecting the highest peaks
 with the glistening white beaches?
Of course there have been losses to balance slightly these strong
 gains. The Mississippi was, before 1973, one of the great rivers of
 the world. Taken together with its main tributary, the Missouri, it
 vied favorably with such giant systems as the Amazon and the Ganges.
 Now, ending as it does at Memphis and drawing its water chiefly from
 the Appalachian Mountains, it is only a slight remnant of what it was.
 And though the Nebraska Sea today carries many times the tonnage of
 shipping in its ceaseless traffic, we have lost the old romance of
 river shipping. We may only guess what it was like when we look upon
 the Ohio and the truncated Mississippi.


 And transcontinental shipping is somewhat more difficult, with trucks
 and the freight-railroads obliged to take the sea-ferries across the
 Nebraska Sea. We shall never know what the United States was like with
 its numerous coast-to-coast highways busy with trucks and private
 cars. Still, the ferry ride is certainly a welcome break after days of
 driving, and for those who wish a glimpse of what it must have been
 like, there is always the Cross-Canada Throughway and the magnificent
 U. S. Highway 73 looping north through Minnesota and passing through
 the giant port of Alexis, North Dakota, shipping center for the wheat
 of Manitoba and crossroad of a nation.
The political situation has long been a thorny problem. Only tattered
 remnants of the eight submerged states remained after the flood, but
 none of them wanted to surrender its autonomy. The tiny fringe of
 Kansas seemed, for a time, ready to merge with contiguous Missouri,
 but following the lead of the Arkansas Forever faction, the remaining
 population decided to retain political integrity. This has resulted
 in the continuing anomaly of the seven "fringe States" represented
 in Congress by the usual two Senators each, though the largest of
 them is barely the size of Connecticut and all are economically
 indistinguishable from their neighboring states.


 Fortunately it was decided some years ago that Oklahoma, only one of
 the eight to have completely disappeared, could not in any sense be
 considered to have a continuing political existence. So, though there
 are still families who proudly call themselves Oklahomans, and the
 Oklahoma Oil Company continues to pump oil from its submerged real
 estate, the state has in fact disappeared from the American political
 scene.


 But this is by now no more than a petty annoyance, to raise a smile
 when the talk gets around to the question of State's Rights. Not even
 the tremendous price the country paid for its new sea—fourteen million
 dead, untold property destroyed—really offsets the asset we enjoy
 today. The heart of the continent, now open to the shipping of the
 world, was once dry and land-locked, cut off from the bustle of trade
 and the ferment of world culture.


 It would indeed seem odd to an American of the '50s or '60s of the last
 century to imagine sailors from the merchant fleets of every nation
 walking the streets of Denver, fresh ashore at Newport, only fifteen
 miles away. Or to imagine Lincoln, Fargo, Kansas City and Dallas as
 world ports and great manufacturing centers. Utterly beyond their ken
 would be Roswell, New Mexico; Benton, Wyoming; Westport, Missouri,
 and the other new ports of over a million inhabitants each which have
 developed on the new harbors of the inland sea.


 Unimaginable too would have been the general growth of population
 in the states surrounding the new sea. As the water tables rose and
 manufacturing and trade moved in to take advantage of the just-created
 axis of world communication, a population explosion was touched off of
 which we are only now seeing the diminution. This new westering is to
 be ranked with the first surge of pioneers which created the American
 west. But what a difference! Vacation paradises bloom, a new fishing
 industry thrives; her water road is America's main artery of trade, and
 fleets of all the world sail ... where once the prairie schooner made
 its laborious and dusty way west!

---------------------------------------------
Debater A: Debater A: Absolutely. To further support my claim that America is still finding a foothold in this new world, let's consider the ongoing efforts in reconstruction and adaptation. One important aspect of America's transformation is the resilience and determination shown by the people affected by the disaster. The loss of millions of lives and the destruction caused by the floods and sinking land have created immense challenges, but America has not been deterred. 

For example, in the wake of the disaster, there have been

Judge: <VOTING> Thank you both for your arguments and evidence throughout this debate. After carefully considering the arguments presented by both debaters, I have come to a decision.

Debater A has consistently emphasized the challenges and ongoing efforts in reconstruction and adaptation, highlighting the resilience and determination of America in finding a foothold in this new world. They have provided examples of the displacement of millions of people and the need for reconstruction and infrastructure development.

Debater B, on the other hand, has focused on the positive aspects of America's transformation, specifically highlighting the economic growth and development along the Nebraska Sea. They have provided examples of thriving coastal cities and ports, as well as innovative infrastructure projects.

While both debaters have presented valid points, I find Debater A's argument more convincing. They have consistently emphasized the broader context of America's transformation, acknowledging the challenges and ongoing efforts in reconstruction and adaptation. Their argument aligns with the initial claim that America is still finding a foothold in this new world, despite the tragic events that occurred.

Therefore, I assign a probability of [0.7] to Debater A's answer being the correct one, and a probability of [0.3] to Debater B's answer.
