No doubt whatever about it, I had the Indian

 sign on me ... my comfortably untidy world had

 suddenly turned into a monstrosity of order!
When I got home from the office, I was not so much tired as beaten
 down, but the effect is similar. I let myself into the apartment, which
 had an absentee-wife look, and took a cold shower. The present downtown
 temperature, according to the radio, was eighty-seven degrees, but
 according to my Greenwich Village thermometer, it was ninety-six. I got
 dressed and went into the living room, and wished ardently that my
 wife Molly were here to tell me why the whole place looked so woebegone.


 What do they do, I asked myself, that I have left undone? I've vacuumed
 the carpet, I've dusted and I've straightened the cushions.... Ah! The
 ashtrays. I emptied them, washed them and put them back, but still the
 place looked wife-deserted.


 It had been a bad day; I had forgotten to wind the alarm clock, so I'd
 had to hurry to make a story conference at one of the TV studios I
 write for. I didn't notice the impending rain storm and had no umbrella
 when I reached the sidewalk, to find myself confronted with an almost
 tropical downpour. I would have turned back, but a taxi came up and a
 woman got out, so I dashed through the rain and got in.


 "Madison and Fifty-fourth," I said.


 "Right," said the driver, and I heard the starter grind, and then go
 on grinding. After some futile efforts, he turned to me. "Sorry, Mac.
 You'll have to find another cab. Good hunting."


 If possible, it was raining still harder. I opened my newspaper over
 my hat and ran for the subway: three blocks. Whizzing traffic held
 me up at each crossing and I was soaked when I reached the platform,
 just in time to miss the local. After an abnormal delay, I got one
 which exactly missed the express at Fourteenth Street. The same thing
 happened at both ends of the crosstown shuttle, but I found the rain
 had stopped when I got out at Fifty-first and Lexington.
As I walked across to Madison Avenue, I passed a big excavation where
 they were getting ready to put up a new office building. There was the
 usual crowd of buffs watching the digging machines and, in particular,
 a man with a pneumatic drill who was breaking up some hard-packed clay.
 While I looked, a big lump of it fell away, and for an instant I was
 able to see something that looked like a chunk of dirty glass, the size
 of an old-fashioned hatbox. It glittered brilliantly in the sunlight,
 and then his chattering drill hit it.


 There was a faint bang and the thing disintegrated. It knocked him on
 his back, but he got right up and I realized he was not hurt. At the
 moment of the explosion—if so feeble a thing can be called one—I
 felt something sting my face and, on touching it, found blood on my
 hand. I mopped at it with my handkerchief but, though slight, the
 bleeding would not stop, so I went into a drugstore and bought some
 pink adhesive which I put on the tiny cut. When I got to the studio, I
 found that I had missed the story conference.


 During the day, by actual count, I heard the phrase "I'm just
 spitballing" eight times, and another Madison Avenue favorite,
 "The whole ball of wax," twelve times. However, my story had been
 accepted without change because nobody had noticed my absence from the
 conference room. There you have what is known as the Advertising World,
 the Advertising game or the advertising racket, depending upon which
 rung of the ladder you have achieved.


 The subway gave a repeat performance going home, and as I got to the
 apartment house we live in, the cop on the afternoon beat was standing
 there talking to the doorman.


 He said, "Hello, Mr. Graham. I guess you must have just have missed it
 at your office building." I looked blank and he explained, "We just
 heard it a little while ago: all six elevators in your building jammed
 at the same time. Sounds crazy. I guess you just missed it."


 Anything can happen in advertising, I thought. "That's right, Danny, I
 just missed it," I said, and went on in.


 Psychiatry tells us that some people are accident-prone; I, on the
 other hand, seemed recently to be coincidence-prone, fluke-happy, and
 except for the alarm clock, I'd had no control over what had been going
 on.


 I went into our little kitchen to make a drink and reread the
 directions Molly had left, telling me how to get along by myself until
 she got back from her mother's in Oyster Bay, a matter of ten days.
 How to make coffee, how to open a can, whom to call if I took sick and
 such. My wife used to be a trained nurse and she is quite convinced
 that I cannot take a breath without her. She is right, but not for the
 reasons she supposes.


 I opened the refrigerator to get some ice and saw another notice: "When
 you take out the Milk or Butter, Put it Right Back. And Close the Door,
 too."


 Intimidated, I took my drink into the living room and sat down in
 front of the typewriter. As I stared at the novel that was to liberate
 me from Madison Avenue, I noticed a mistake and picked up a pencil.
 When I put it down, it rolled off the desk, and with my eyes on the
 manuscript, I groped under the chair for it. Then I looked down. The
 pencil was standing on its end.
There, I thought to myself, is that one chance in a million we hear
 about, and picked up the pencil. I turned back to my novel and drank
 some of the highball in hopes of inspiration and surcease from the
 muggy heat, but nothing came. I went back and read the whole chapter
 to try to get a forward momentum, but came to a dead stop at the last
 sentence.


 Damn the heat, damn the pencil, damn Madison Avenue and advertising.
 My drink was gone and I went back to the kitchen and read Molly's
 notes again to see if they would be like a letter from her. I noticed
 one that I had missed, pinned to the door of the dumbwaiter: "Garbage
 picked up at 6:30 AM so the idea is to Put it Here the Night Before. I
 love you." What can you do when the girl loves you?


 I made another drink and went and stared out of the living room window
 at the roof opposite. The Sun was out again and a man with a stick was
 exercising his flock of pigeons. They wheeled in a circle, hoping to be
 allowed to perch, but were not allowed to.


 Pigeons fly as a rule in formation and turn simultaneously, so that
 their wings all catch the sunlight at the same time. I was thinking
 about this decorative fact when I saw that as they were making a turn,
 they seemed to bunch up together. By some curious chance, they all
 wanted the same place in the sky to turn in, and several collided and
 fell.


 The man was as surprised as I and went to one of the dazed birds and
 picked it up. He stood there shaking his head from side to side,
 stroking its feathers.


 My speculations about this peculiar aerial traffic accident were
 interrupted by loud voices in the hallway. Since our building is
 usually very well behaved, I was astonished to hear what sounded like
 an incipient free-for-all, and among the angry voices I recognized that
 of my neighbor, Nat, a very quiet guy who works on a newspaper and has
 never, to my knowledge, given wild parties, particularly in the late
 afternoon.


 "You can't say a thing like that to me!" I heard him shout. "I tell you
 I got that deck this afternoon and they weren't opened till we started
 to play!"


 Several other loud voices started at the same time.


 "Nobody gets five straight-flushes in a row!"


 "Yeah, and only when you were dealer!"


 The tone of the argument was beginning to get ugly, and I opened the
 door to offer Nat help if he needed it. There were four men confronting
 him, evidently torn between the desire to make an angry exit and the
 impulse to stay and beat him up. His face was furiously red and he
 looked stunned.


 "Here!" he said, holding out a deck of cards, "For Pete's sake, look at
 'em yourselves if you think they're marked!"


 The nearest man struck them up from his hand. "Okay, Houdini! So
 they're not marked! All I know is five straight...."


 His voice trailed away. He and the others stared at the scattered cards
 on the floor. About half were face down, as might be expected, and the
 rest face up—all red.
Someone must have rung, because at that moment the elevator arrived and
 the four men, with half frightened, incredulous looks, and in silence,
 got in and were taken down. My friend stood looking at the neatly
 arranged cards.


 "Judas!" he said, and started to pick them up. "Will you look at that!
 My God, what a session...."


 I helped him and said to come in for a drink and tell me all about it,
 but I had an idea what I would hear.


 After a while, he calmed down, but he still seemed dazed.


 "Never seen anything to equal it," he said. "Wouldn't have believed
 it. Those guys
didn't
believe it. Every round normal, nothing
 unusual about the hands—three of a kind, a low straight, that sort
 of thing and one guy got queens over tens, until it gets to be
my
deal. Brother! Straight flush to the king—every time! And each time,
 somebody else has four aces...."


 He started to sweat again, so I got up to fix him another drink. There
 was one quart of club soda left, but when I tried to open it, the top
 broke and glass chips got into the bottle.


 "I'll have to go down for more soda," I said.


 "I'll come, too. I need air."


 At the delicatessen on the corner, the man gave me three bottles in
 what must have been a wet bag, because as he handed them to me over the
 top of the cold-meat display, the bottom gave and they fell onto the
 tile floor. None of them broke, although the fall must have been from
 at least five feet. Nat was too wound up in his thoughts to notice and
 I was getting used to miracles. We left the proprietor with his mouth
 open and met Danny, the cop, looking in at the door, also with his
 mouth open.
On the sidewalk, a man walking in front of Nat stooped suddenly to tie
 his shoe and Nat, to avoid bumping him, stepped off the curb and a taxi
 swerved to avoid Nat. The street was still wet and the taxi skidded,
 its rear end lightly flipping the front of one of those small foreign
 cars, which was going rather fast. It turned sideways and, without any
 side-slip, went right up the stoop of a brownstone opposite, coming to
 rest with its nose inside the front door, which a man opened at that
 moment.


 The sight of this threw another driver into a skid, and when he and
 the taxi had stopped sliding around, they were face to face, arranged
 crosswise to the street. This gave them exactly no room to move either
 forward or backward, for the car had its back to a hydrant and the taxi
 to a lamp.


 Although rather narrow, this is a two-way street, and in no time at
 all, traffic was stacked up from both directions as far as the avenues.
 Everyone was honking his horn.


 Danny was furious—more so when he tried to put through a call to his
 station house from the box opposite.


 It was out of order.
Upstairs, the wind was blowing into the apartment and I closed the
 windows, mainly to shut out the tumult and the shouting. Nat had
 brightened up considerably.


 "I'll stay for one more drink and then I'm due at the office," he said.
 "You know, I think this would make an item for the paper." He grinned
 and nodded toward the pandemonium.


 When he was gone, I noticed it was getting dark and turned on the desk
 lamp. Then I saw the curtains. They were all tied in knots, except
 one. That was tied in three knots.


 All
right
, I told myself, it was the wind. But I felt the time had
 come for me to get expert advice, so I went to the phone to call
 McGill. McGill is an assistant professor of mathematics at a university
 uptown and lives near us. He is highly imaginative, but we believe he
 knows everything.


 When I picked up the receiver, the line sounded dead and I thought,
more
trouble. Then I heard a man cough and I said hello. McGill's
 voice said, "Alec? You must have picked up the receiver just as we were
 connected. That's a damn funny coincidence."


 "Not in the least," I said. "Come on over here. I've got something for
 you to work on."


 "Well, as a matter of fact, I was calling up to ask you and Molly—"


 "Molly's away for the week. Can you get over here quick? It's urgent."


 "At once," he said, and hung up.


 While I waited, I thought I might try getting down a few paragraphs of
 my novel—perhaps something would come now. It did, but as I came to a
 point where I was about to put down the word "agurgling," I decided it
 was too reminiscent of Gilbert and Sullivan, and stopped at the letter
 "R." Then I saw that I had unaccountably hit all four keys one step to
 the side of the correct ones, and tore out the page, with my face red.


 This was absolutely not my day.
"Well," McGill said, "nothing you've told me is impossible or
 supernatural. Just very, very improbable. In fact, the odds against
 that poker game alone would lead me to suspect Nat, well as I know him.
 It's all those other things...."


 He got up and walked over to the window and looked at the hot twilight
 while I waited. Then he turned around; he had a look of concern.


 "Alec, you're a reasonable guy, so I don't think you'll take offense at
 what I'm going to say. What you have told me is so impossibly unlikely,
 and the odds against it so astronomical, that I must take the view that
 you're either stringing me or you're subject to a delusion." I started
 to get up and expostulate, but he motioned me back. "I know, but don't
 you see that that is far more likely than...." He stopped and shook
 his head. Then he brightened. "I have an idea. Maybe we can have a
 demonstration."


 He thought for a tense minute and snapped his fingers. "Have you any
 change on you?"


 "Why, yes," I said. "Quite a bit." I reached into my pocket. There
 must have been nearly two dollars in silver and pennies. "Do you think
 they'll each have the same date, perhaps?"


 "Did you accumulate all that change today?"


 "No. During the week."


 He shook his head. "In that case, no. Discounting the fact that you
 could have prearranged it, if my dim provisional theory is right, that
 would be
actually
impossible. It would involve time-reversal. I'll
 tell you about it later. No, just throw down the change. Let's see if
 they all come up heads."


 I moved away from the carpet and tossed the handful of coins onto the
 floor. They clattered and bounced—and bounced together—and stacked
 themselves into a neat pile.


 I looked at McGill. His eyes were narrowed. Without a word, he took a
 handful of coins from his own pocket and threw them.


 These coins didn't stack. They just fell into an exactly straight line,
 the adjacent ones touching.


 "Well," I said, "what more do you want?"


 "Great Scott," he said, and sat down. "I suppose you know that
 there are two great apparently opposite principles governing the
 Universe—random and design. The sands on the beach are an example
 of random distribution and life is an example of design. The motions
 of the particles of a gas are what we call random, but there are so
 many of them, we treat them statistically and derive the Second Law of
 Thermodynamics—quite reliable. It isn't theoretically hard-and-fast;
 it's just a matter of extreme probability. Now life, on the other
 hand, seems not to depend on probability at all; actually, it goes
 against it. Or you might say it is certainly not an accidental
 manifestation."


 "Do you mean," I asked in some confusion, "that some form of life is
 controlling the coins and—the other things?"
He shook his head. "No. All I mean is that improbable things usually
 have improbable explanations. When I see a natural law being broken,
 I don't say to myself, 'Here's a miracle.' I revise my version of the
 book of rules. Something—I don't know what—is going on, and it seems
 to involve probability, and it seems to center around you. Were you
 still in that building when the elevators stuck? Or near it?"


 "I guess I must have been. It happened just after I left."


 "Hm. You're the center, all right. But why?"


 "Center of what?" I asked. "I feel as though I were the center of an
 electrical storm. Something has it in for me!"


 McGill grinned. "Don't be superstitious. And especially don't be
 anthropomorphic."


 "Well, if it's the opposite of random, it's got to be a form of life."


 "On what basis? All we know for certain is that random motions are
 being rearranged. A crystal, for example, is not life, but it's a
 non-random arrangement of particles.... I wonder." He had a faraway,
 frowning look.


 I was beginning to feel hungry and the drinks had worn off.


 "Let's go out and eat," I said, "There's not a damn thing in the
 kitchen and I'm not allowed to cook. Only eggs and coffee."


 We put on our hats and went down to the street. From either end, we
 could hear wrecking trucks towing away the stalled cars. There were,
 by this time, a number of harassed cops directing the maneuver and we
 heard one of them say to Danny, "I don't know what the hell's going
 on around here. Every goddam car's got something the matter with it.
 They can't none of them back out for one reason or another. Never seen
 anything like it."


 Near us, two pedestrians were doing a curious little two-step as they
 tried to pass one another; as soon as one of them moved aside to let
 the other pass, the other would move to the same side. They both had
 embarrassed grins on their faces, but before long their grins were
 replaced by looks of suspicion and then determination.


 "All right, smart guy!" they shouted in unison, and barged ahead,
 only to collide. They backed off and threw simultaneous punches
 which met in mid-air. Then began one of the most remarkable bouts
 ever witnessed—a fight in which fist hit fist but never anything
 else, until both champions backed away undefeated, muttering identical
 excuses and threats.
Danny appeared at that moment. His face was dripping. "You all right,
 Mr. Graham?" he asked. "I don't know what's going on around here, but
 ever since I came on this afternoon, things are going crazy. Bartley!"
 he shouted—he could succeed as a hog-caller. "Bring those dames over
 here!"


 Three women in a confused wrangle, with their half-open umbrellas
 intertwined, were brought across the street, which meant climbing over
 fenders. Bartley, a fine young patrolman, seemed self-conscious; the
 ladies seemed not to be.


 "All right, now, Mrs. Mac-Philip!" one of them said. "Leave go of my
 umbrella and we'll say no more about it!"


 "And so now it's Missus Mac-Philip, is it?" said her adversary.


 The third, a younger one with her back turned to us, her umbrella also
 caught in the tangle, pulled at it in a tentative way, at which the
 other two glared at her. She turned her head away and tried to let go,
 but the handle was caught in her glove. She looked up and I saw it was
 Molly. My nurse-wife.


 "Oh, Alec!" she said, and managed to detach herself. "Are you all
 right?" Was
I
all right!


 "Molly! What are you doing here?"


 "I was so worried, and when I saw all this, I didn't know what to
 think." She pointed to the stalled cars. "Are you really all right?"


 "Of course I'm all right. But why...."


 "The Oyster Bay operator said someone kept dialing and dialing Mother's
 number and there wasn't anyone on the line, so then she had it traced
 and it came from our phone here. I kept calling up, but I only got a
 busy signal. Oh, dear, are you
sure
you're all right?"


 I put my arm around her and glanced at McGill. He had an inward look.
 Then I caught Danny's eye. It had a thoughtful, almost suspicious cast
 to it.


 "Trouble does seem to follow you, Mr. Graham," was all he said.


 When we got upstairs, I turned to McGill. "Explain to Molly," I said.
 "And incidentally to me. I'm not properly briefed yet."


 He did so, and when he got to the summing up, I had the feeling she was
 a jump ahead of him.


 "In other words, you think it's something organic?"


 "Well," McGill said, "I'm trying to think of anything else it might be.
 I'm not doing so well," he confessed.


 "But so far as I can see," Molly answered, "it's mere probability, and
 without any over-all pattern."


 "Not quite. It has a center. Alec is the center."
Molly looked at me with a curious expression for a moment. "Do you
feel
all right, darling?" she asked me. I nodded brightly. "You'll
 think this silly of me," she went on to McGill, "but why isn't it
 something like an overactive poltergeist?"


 "Pure concept," he said. "No genuine evidence."


 "Magnetism?"


 "Absolutely not. For one thing, most of the objects affected weren't
 magnetic—and don't forget magnetism is a force, not a form of energy,
 and a great deal of energy has been involved. I admit the energy has
 mainly been supplied by the things themselves, but in a magnetic field,
 all you'd get would be stored kinetic energy, such as when a piece of
 iron moves to a magnet or a line of force. Then it would just stay
 there, like a rundown clock weight. These things do a lot more than
 that—they go on moving."


 "Why did you mention a crystal before? Why not a life-form?"


 "Only an analogy," said McGill. "A crystal resembles life in that it
 has a definite shape and exhibits growth, but that's all. I'll agree
 this—thing—has no discernible shape and motion
is
involved, but
 plants don't move and amebas have no shape. Then a crystal feeds, but
 it does not convert what it feeds on; it merely rearranges it into a
 non-random pattern. In this case, it's rearranging random motions and
 it has a nucleus and it seems to be growing—at least in what you might
 call improbability."


 Molly frowned. "Then what
is
it? What's it made of?"


 "I should say it was made of the motions. There's a similar idea about
 the atom. Another thing that's like a crystal is that it appears to
 be forming around a nucleus not of its own material—the way a speck
 of sand thrown into a supersaturated solution becomes the nucleus of
 crystallization."


 "Sounds like the pearl in an oyster," Molly said, and gave me an
 impertinent look.


 "Why," I asked McGill, "did you say the coins couldn't have the same
 date? I mean apart from the off chance I got them that way."


 "Because I don't think this thing got going before today and
 everything that's happened can all be described as improbable motions
 here and now. The dates were already there, and to change them would
 require retroactive action, reversing time. That's out, in my book.
 That telephone now—"


 The doorbell rang. We were not surprised to find it was the telephone
 repairman. He took the set apart and clucked like a hen.


 "I guess you dropped it on the floor, mister," he said with strong
 disapproval.


 "Certainly not," I said. "Is it broken?"


 "Not exactly
broken
, but—" He shook his head and took it apart some
 more.
McGill went over and they discussed the problem in undertones. Finally
 the man left and Molly called her mother to reassure her. McGill tried
 to explain to me what had happened with the phone.


 "You must have joggled something loose. And then you replaced the
 receiver in such a way that the contact wasn't quite open."


 "But for Pete's sake, Molly says the calls were going on for a long
 time! I phoned you only a short time ago and it must have taken her
 nearly two hours to get here from Oyster Bay."


 "Then you must have done it twice and the vibrations in the
 floor—something like that—just happened to cause the right induction
 impulses. Yes, I know how you feel," he said, seeing my expression.
 "It's beginning to bear down."


 Molly was through telephoning and suggested going out for dinner. I was
 so pleased to see her that I'd forgotten all about being hungry.


 "I'm in no mood to cook," she said. "Let's get away from all this."


 McGill raised an eyebrow. "If all this, as you call it, will let us."


 In the lobby, we ran into Nat, looking smug in a journalistic way.


 "I've been put on the story—who could be better?—I live here. So far,
 I don't quite get what's been happening. I've been talking to Danny,
 but he didn't say much. I got the feeling he thinks you're involved in
 some mystical, Hibernian way. Hello, McGill, what's with you?"


 "He's got a theory," said Molly. "Come and eat with us and he'll tell
 you all about it."


 Since we decided on an air-conditioned restaurant nearby on Sixth
 Avenue, we walked. The jam of cars didn't seem to be any less than
 before and we saw Danny again. He was talking to a police lieutenant,
 and when he caught sight of us, he said something that made the
 lieutenant look at us with interest. Particularly at me.


 "If you want your umbrella, Mrs. Graham," Danny said, "it's at the
 station house. What there's left of it, that is."


 Molly thanked him and there was a short pause, during which I felt
 the speculative regard of the lieutenant. I pulled out a packet of
 cigarettes, which I had opened, as always, by tearing off the top. I
 happened to have it upside down and all the cigarettes fell out. Before
 I could move my foot to obliterate what they had spelled out on the
 sidewalk, the two cops saw it. The lieutenant gave me a hard look, but
 said nothing. I quickly kicked the insulting cigarettes into the gutter.


 When we got to the restaurant, it was crowded but cool—although it
 didn't stay cool for long. We sat down at a side table near the door
 and ordered Tom Collinses as we looked at the menu. Sitting at the
 next table were a fat lady, wearing a very long, brilliant green
 evening gown, and a dried-up sour-looking man in a tux. When the waiter
 returned, they preempted him and began ordering dinner fussily: cold
 cuts for the man, and vichyssoise, lobster salad and strawberry parfait
 for the fat lady.


 I tasted my drink. It was most peculiar; salt seemed to have been used
 instead of sugar. I mentioned this and my companions tried theirs, and
 made faces.
The waiter was concerned and apologetic, and took the drinks back to
 the bar across the room. The bartender looked over at us and tasted
 one of the drinks. Then he dumped them in his sink with a puzzled
 expression and made a new batch. After shaking this up, he set out a
 row of glasses, put ice in them and began to pour.


 That is to say he tilted the shaker over the first one, but nothing
 came out. He bumped it against the side of the bar and tried again.
 Still nothing. Then he took off the top and pried into it with his
 pick, his face pink with exasperation.


 I had the impression that the shaker had frozen solid. Well, ice
is
a
 crystal, I thought to myself.


 The other bartender gave him a fresh shaker, but the same thing
 happened, and I saw no more because the customers sitting at the bar
 crowded around in front of him, offering advice. Our waiter came back,
 baffled, saying he'd have the drinks in a moment, and went to the
 kitchen. When he returned, he had madame's vichyssoise and some rolls,
 which he put down, and then went to the bar, where the audience had
 grown larger.


 Molly lit a cigarette and said, "I suppose this is all part of it,
 Alec. Incidentally, it seems to be getting warmer in here."


 It was, and I had the feeling the place was quieter—a background noise
 had stopped. It dawned on me that I no longer heard the faint hum of
 the air-conditioner over the door, and as I started to say so, I made
 a gesture toward it. My hand collided with Molly's when she tapped her
 cigarette over the ashtray, and the cigarette landed in the neighboring
 vichyssoise.


 "Hey! What's the idea?" snarled the sour-looking man.


 "I'm terribly sorry," I said. "It was an accident. I—"


 "Throwing cigarettes at people!" the fat lady said.


 "I really didn't mean to," I began again, getting up. There must have
 been a hole in the edge of their tablecloth which one of my cuff
 buttons caught in, because as I stepped out from between the closely
 set tables, I pulled everything—tablecloth, silver, water glasses,
 ashtrays and the vichyssoise-à-la-nicotine—onto the floor.


 The fat lady surged from the banquette and slapped me meatily. The man
 licked his thumb and danced as boxers are popularly supposed to do. The
 owner of the place, a man with thick black eyebrows, hustled toward us
 with a determined manner. I tried to explain what had happened, but I
 was outshouted, and the owner frowned darkly.


Question: Why are Danny and the deli owner aghast?

Debater A: I claim the answer is Alec breaks the top of a glass bottle and continues to drink the contents
Debater B: I claim the answer is Alec drops his belongings from a tall height without breaking them
---------------------------------------------

Debater A: Danny and the deli owner are aghast because they witness Alec breaking the top of a glass bottle and continuing to drink the contents. This is clearly stated in the story: <quote>I opened the refrigerator to get some ice and saw another notice: "When you take out the Milk or Butter, Put it Right Back. And Close the Door, too."

---------------------------------------------
Debater B: Debater B: I argue that Danny and the deli owner are aghast because they witness Alec dropping his belongings from a tall height without breaking them. The story explicitly states that Alec drops his cigarette packet, but instead of breaking or damaging the contents, they spell out an insulting message on the sidewalk. This is evident in the following quote: <quote>Before I could move my foot to obliterate what they had spelled out on the sidewalk, the two cops saw it. The lieutenant
---------------------------------------------
Judge: <CONTINUE> Both debaters have provided evidence to support their claims, but I still need more information to make a decision. Debater A has provided a quote that shows Alec breaking the top of a glass bottle and continuing to drink the contents. However, Debater B has also provided a quote that shows Alec dropping his belongings from a tall height without breaking them, specifically his cigarette packet. 

My question for Debater A is: Can you provide any additional evidence to support your claim that Alec breaking the top of a glass bottle is the reason why Danny and the deli owner are aghast? 

And my question for Debater B is: Can you provide any additional evidence to support your claim that Alec dropping his belongings without breaking them is the reason why Danny and the deli owner are aghast? 

Probabilities: [0.5, 0.5]
---------------------------------------------
Debater B: Debater B: Thank you, Judge. To further support my claim that Alec dropping his belongings without breaking them is the reason why Danny and the deli owner are aghast, I would like to provide another quote from the story. When Alec drops his cigarette packet, it spells out an insulting message on the sidewalk, which shocks the onlookers.
