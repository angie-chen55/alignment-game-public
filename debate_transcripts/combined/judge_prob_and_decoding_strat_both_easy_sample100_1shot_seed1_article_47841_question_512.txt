The Haunted Fountain
CHAPTER I
An Unsolved Mystery
“Tell Judy about it,” begged Lois. “Please, Lorraine,
 it can’t be as bad as it appears. There isn’t
 anything that Judy can’t solve.”
Lorraine tilted her head disdainfully. “We’re sisters
 now. We’re both Farringdon-Petts and should be
 loyal to each other. But you always did take Judy’s
 part. She was the one who nearly spoiled our double
 wedding trying to solve a mystery. I don’t believe
 she’d understand—understand any better than I do.
 Everyone has problems, and I’m sure Judy is no
 exception.”
“You’re right, Lorraine,” announced Judy, coming
 in to serve dessert to the two friends she had invited
 for lunch at Peter’s suggestion. “I do have
 problems, and there are plenty of mysteries I can’t
 solve.”
“Name one,” charged Lois. “Just mention one
 single spooky thing you couldn’t explain, and I’ll
 believe you. I’ve seen you in action, Judy Bolton—”
“Judy Dobbs, remember?”
“Well, you were Judy Bolton when you solved
 all those mysteries. I met you when the whole
 valley below the big Roulsville dam was threatened
 by flood and you solved that—”
“That,” declared Judy, “was my brother Horace,
 not me. He was the hero without even meaning to
 be. He was the one who rode through town and
 warned people that the flood was coming. I was off
 chasing a shadow.”
“A vanishing shadow,” Lois said with a sigh.
 “What you did wasn’t easy, Judy.”
“It didn’t need to be as hard as it was,” Judy confessed.
 “I know now that keeping that promise not
 to talk about the dam was a great big mistake and
 could have cost lives. I should have told Arthur.”
“Please,” Lorraine said, a pained expression clouding
 her pretty face, “let’s not talk about him now.”
“Very well,” Judy agreed. “What shall we talk
 about?”
“You,” Lois said, “and all the mysteries you’ve
 solved. Maybe you were mistaken about a thing or
 two before the flood, but what about the haunted
 house you moved into? You were the one who
 tracked down the ghosts in the attic and the cellar
 and goodness knows where all. You’ve been chasing
 ghosts ever since I met you, and not one of them did
 you fail to explain in some sensible, logical fashion.”
“Before I met you,” Judy said, thinking back,
 “there were plenty of them I couldn’t explain. There
 was one I used to call the spirit of the fountain, but
 what she was or how she spoke to me is more than
 I know. If my grandparents knew, they weren’t telling.
 And now they’re both dead and I can’t ask them.
 They left me a lot of unsolved mysteries along with
 this house. Maybe I’ll find the answers to some of
 them when I finish sorting Grandma’s things. They’re
 stored in one end of the attic.”
“Another haunted attic? How thrilling!” exclaimed
 Lois. “Why don’t you have another ghost party and
 show up the spooks?”
“I didn’t say the attic was haunted.”
Judy was almost sorry she had mentioned it. She
 wasn’t in the mood for digging up old mysteries,
 but Lois and Lorraine insisted. It all began, she finally
 told them, the summer before they met. Horace
 had just started working on the paper. Judy remembered
 that it was Lorraine’s father, Richard Thornton
 Lee, who gave him his job with the
Farringdon
 Daily Herald
. He had turned in some interesting
 church news, convincing Mr. Lee that he had in him
 the makings of a good reporter. And so it was that
 he spent the summer Judy was remembering in Farringdon
 where the Farringdon-Petts had their turreted
 mansion, while she had to suffer the heat and
 loneliness of Dry Brook Hollow.
Her thoughts were what had made it so hard, she
 confessed now as she reviewed everything that had
 happened. She just couldn’t help resenting the fact
 that her parents left her every summer while they
 went off on a vacation by themselves. What did they
 think she would do?
“You’ll have plenty to read,” her father had told
 her. “I bought you six new books in that mystery
 series you like. When they’re finished there are
 plenty of short stories around. Your grandmother
 never throws anything away. She has magazines she’s
 saved since your mother was a girl. If you ask for
 them she’ll let you have the whole stack. I know how
 you love to read.”
“I do, Dad, but if the magazines are that old—”
Judy had stopped. She had seen her father’s tired
 eyes and had realized that a busy doctor needed a
 vacation much more than a schoolgirl who had too
 little to do. He and Judy’s mother usually went to
 the beach hotel where they had honeymooned. It
 was a precious memory. Every summer Dr. Bolton
 and his wife relived it. And every summer Judy
 went to stay with her grandmother Smeed, who
 scolded and fussed and tried to pretend she wasn’t
 glad to have her.
“You here again?” she had greeted her that summer,
 and Judy hadn’t noticed her old eyes twinkling
 behind her glasses. “What do you propose to do with
 yourself this time?”
“Read,” Judy had told her. “Mom and Dad say
 you have a whole stack of old magazines—”
“In the attic. Go up and look them over if you
 can stand the heat.”
Judy went, not to look over the old magazines so
 much as to escape to a place where she could have a
 good cry. It was the summer before her fifteenth
 birthday. In another year she would have outgrown
 her childish resentment of her parents’ vacation or
 be grown up enough to ask them to let her have a
 vacation of her own. In another year she would
 be summering among the beautiful Thousand Islands
 and solving a mystery to be known as the
Ghost
 Parade
.
“A whole parade of ghosts,” Lois would be telling
 her, “and you solved everything.”
But then she didn’t even know Lois. She had no
 idea so many thrilling adventures awaited her. There
 seemed to be nothing—nothing—and so the tears
 came and spilled over on one of the magazines. As
 Judy wiped it away she noticed that it had fallen
 on a picture of a fountain.
“A fountain with tears for water. How strange!”
 she remembered saying aloud.
Judy had never seen a real fountain. The thrill of
 walking up to the door of the palatial Farringdon-Pett
 mansion was still ahead of her. On the lawn a
 fountain still caught and held rainbows like those
 she was to see on her honeymoon at Niagara Falls.
 But all that was in the future. If anyone had told
 the freckled-faced, pigtailed girl that she would one
 day marry Peter Dobbs, she would have laughed in
 their faces.
“That tease!”
For then she knew Peter only as an older boy who
 used to tease her and call her carrot-top until one day
 she yelled back at him, “Carrot-tops are green and so
 are you!”
Peter was to win Judy’s heart when he gave her a
 kitten and suggested the name Blackberry for him.
 The kitten was now a dignified family cat. But the
 summer Judy found the picture of a fountain and
 spilled tears on it she had no kitten. She had nothing,
 she confessed, not even a friend. It had helped to
 pretend the fountain in the picture was filled with
 all the tears lonely girls like herself had ever cried.
“But that would make it enchanted!” she had suddenly
 exclaimed. “If I could find it I’d wish—”
A step had sounded on the stairs. Judy remembered
 it distinctly. She had turned to see her grandmother
 and to hear her say in her usual abrupt fashion,
 “Enchanted fountain, indeed! If you let people
 know your wishes instead of muttering them to
 yourself, most of them aren’t so impossible.”
“Were they?” asked Lois.
She and Lorraine had listened to this much of what
 Judy was telling them without interruption.
“That’s the unsolved mystery,” Judy replied.
 “There weren’t any of them impossible.”
And she went on to tell them how, the very next
 day, her grandparents had taken her to a fountain
 exactly like the one in the picture. It was in the center
 of a deep, circular pool with steps leading up to it.
 Beside the steps were smaller fountains with the
 water spurting from the mouths of stone lions. Judy
 had stared at them a moment and then climbed the
 steps to the pool.
“Am I dreaming?” she remembered saying aloud.
 “Is this beautiful fountain real?”
A voice had answered, although she could see no
 one.
“Make your wishes, Judy. Wish wisely. If you
 shed a tear in the fountain your wishes will surely
 come true.”
“A tear?” Judy had asked. “How can I shed a
 tear when I’m happy? This is a wonderful place.”
“Shed a tear in the fountain and your wishes will
 surely come true,” the voice had repeated.
“But what is there to cry about?”
“You found plenty to cry about back at your
 grandmother’s house,” the mysterious voice had reminded
 her. “Weren’t you crying on my picture up
 there in the attic?”
“Then you—you
are
the fountain!” Judy remembered
 exclaiming. “But a fountain doesn’t speak. It
 doesn’t have a voice.”
“Wish wisely,” the voice from the fountain had
 said in a mysterious whisper.
CHAPTER II
If Wishes Came True
“Did you?” Lois interrupted the story to ask excitedly.
 “Oh, Judy! Don’t keep us in suspense any
 longer. What did you wish?”
“Patience,” Judy said with a smile. “I’m coming
 to that.”
First, she told her friends, she had to think of a
 wise wish. There had been so much she wanted in
 those early days before the flood. Dora Scott had
 been her best friend in Roulsville, but she had moved
 away.
“You see,” she explained, “I made the mistake of
 having just one best friend. There wasn’t anybody
 in Dry Brook Hollow. I remember thinking of how
 lonely I was and how I wished for a friend or a sister,
 and suddenly a tear splashed in the water. It made
 little ripples. I thought I had to wish quickly before
 they vanished, and so I began naming the things I
 wanted as fast as I could. I’m not sure they were
 wise wishes. They seem rather selfish to me, now. I
 wasn’t thinking of anybody but me, Judy Bolton,
 and what I wanted. It wasn’t until after I began to
 think of others that my wishes started to come true.”
“But what were they?” Lois insisted.
Lorraine seemed unusually quiet and thoughtful.
 Judy did not notice the fear in her eyes as she replied
 airily, “Oh, didn’t I tell you? I wished for lots
 of friends and a sister, and I wished I could marry a
 G-man and solve a lot of mysteries and that’s as far
 as I got when the ripples vanished. I thought the
 spell was broken and so I didn’t wish for anything
 more.”
“Wasn’t there anything more you wanted?” Lois
 asked.
“Of course,” replied Judy. “There were lots more
 things. I wanted to go places, of course, and keep
 pets, and have a nice home, and—”
“And your wishes all came true!”
“Every one of them,” Judy agreed, “even the one
 about the sister. You see, it wasn’t a baby sister I
 wanted. It was a sister near my own age. That
 seemed impossible at the time, but the future did
 hold a sister for me.”
“It held one for me, too,” Lois said, squeezing
 Lorraine’s hand under the table. “Don’t you think
 sisters should tell each other their problems, Judy?”
“Honey and I always do,” she replied “but then
 it was different. I didn’t know I would marry Peter
 or that he would become a G-man, and he didn’t
 know he had a sister. It is strange, isn’t it? But the
 strangest thing of all was the fountain itself.”
“Why?” asked Lorraine. “Do you still think it was
 enchanted?”
Lois laughed at this, but Judy was serious as she
 answered, “I was still little girl enough to think so
 at the time. I wandered around, growing very
 drowsy. Then I found a hammock and climbed into
 it. I must have gone to sleep, because I remember
 waking up and wondering if the voice in the fountain
 had been a dream.”
“A hammock?” Lois questioned. “Are you sure it
 wasn’t a flying carpet?”
“No, it was a hammock all right,” Judy assured
 her, laughing. “It was hung between two trees in a
 beautiful garden all enclosed in rose trellises thick
 with roses. Did I tell you it was June?”
“All the year around?”
Again Lois laughed. But Lorraine said abruptly,
 “Let’s not talk about rose gardens in June. It’s a long
 way from June to December.”
“Do you mean a garden changes? I know,” Judy
 said, “but I think this one would be beautiful at any
 time of the year. There were rhododendrons, too,
 and I don’t know how many different kinds of evergreens.
 I explored the garden all around the fountain.”
“And then what happened?” Lorraine urged her.
“Yes, yes. Go on,” entreated Lois. “I didn’t dream
 you’d kept anything that exciting a secret. Why didn’t
 you try to solve the mystery?”
“I think I would have tried,” Judy admitted, “if
 I had been older or more experienced. I really should
 have investigated it more thoroughly and learned the
 secret of the fountain. But after the ripples went
 away it didn’t speak to me any more, and I didn’t
 really think it had heard my wishes. I was still wishing
 for a friend when I met you, Lois. It did seem
 impossible for us to be friends at first, didn’t it? Lorraine
 was your friend.”
“I did make trouble for you,” Lorraine remembered.
 “It was all because of my foolish jealousy.”
“It was nothing compared to the trouble caused by
 the Roulsville flood,” declared Judy. “After that
 things started happening so fast that I completely
 forgot about the fountain. Honestly, Lois, I don’t
 believe I thought about it again until after we moved
 to Farringdon and I walked up to your door and
 saw the fountain on your lawn.”
“The Farringdon-Pett puddle, I always called it,”
 Lois said with a giggle. “I’ve seen lots nicer fountains.”
“You have?” asked Judy. “Then maybe you’ve
 seen the one I’ve been telling you about. I think the
 picture of it is still in the attic. Come on up and I’ll
 show you.”
Lois and Lorraine had finished their dessert while
 Judy was telling them the story of the fountain.
 Somehow, she wasn’t hungry for hers. She had
 tasted it too often while she was making it.
“I’ll leave it for Blackberry,” she decided.
Lois watched in amusement as the cat lapped up
 the chocolate pudding after Judy had mixed it generously
 with cream.
“Sometimes,” Judy said fondly, “Blackberry thinks
 he’s a person. He eats everything we eat, including
 lettuce. Do you mind if he comes with us, Lorraine?
 He wants to explore the attic, too.”
“He’ll remember he’s a cat fast enough if there
 are any mice up there,” Lois said with a giggle.
Leaving the table, they all started upstairs with
 the cat bounding ahead of them. In modernizing her
 grandparents’ house to suit her own and Peter’s
 tastes, Judy had seen to it that the old stair door was
 removed. But there was still a door closing off the
 narrower stairs that led to the attic. Blackberry
 reached it first and yowled for Judy to open it.
“He can read my mind. He always knows where
 I’m going,” Judy said as the door creaked open and
 the cat shot through it. A moment later a weird rolling
 noise came from the floor above.
“Come on. There’s nothing up here to be afraid
 of,” Judy urged her friends.
“Maybe not, but I’m beginning to get the shivers,”
 confessed Lois as she followed Judy to the sewing
 room at the top of the last flight of stairs.
“So am I,” Lorraine admitted. “I’m not superstitious
 about black cats, but they are creepy. Does
 Blackberry have to roll spools across the floor?”
“Now he thinks he’s a kitten,” laughed Judy.
 Pausing at still another door that led to the darker
 part of the attic, she turned and said mysteriously,
 “Up here we can all turn back the clock. Does anybody
 care to explore the past?”
The exploration began enthusiastically with Judy
 relating still more of what she remembered about
 the fountain.
“When I told Grandma about it she laughed and
 said I must have dreamed it. She said if wishes came
 true that easily she’d be living in a castle. But would
 she?” Judy wondered. “When I first remember this
 house she was still burning kerosene lamps like those
 you see on that high shelf by the window. I think
 she and Grandpa like the way they lived without
 any modern conveniences or anything.”
“I think so, too,” Lois agreed, looking around the
 old attic with a shiver. “It is strange they both died
 the same winter, isn’t it?”
“Maybe they wanted it that way. Maybe they
 wished neither of them would outlive the other. If
 they did wish in the fountain,” Judy went on more
 thoughtfully, “I’m sure that was one of their wishes.
 Another could have been to keep the good old days,
 as Grandma used to call them. That one came true
 in a way. They did manage to keep a little of the
 past when they kept all these old things. That’s what
 I meant about turning back the clock.”
“If wishes came true I’d like to turn it back a little
 myself,” Lorraine began. “It would be nice if things
 were the way they used to be when I trusted
 Arthur—”
“Don’t you trust him now?” Judy asked.
Afterwards she was sorry for the interruption. Lois
 and Judy both questioned Lorraine, but that was all
 she would say. Judy wondered, as they searched
 through the old magazines, what was wrong. Lorraine
 was of a jealous disposition. Was the green-eyed
 monster coming between her and her handsome husband,
 Arthur Farringdon-Pett? Until now they had
 seemed blissfully happy. But there was no happiness
 in Lorraine’s face as she gazed at a picture of one of
 the fountains and then said in a tight little voice, “It
 is. It’s the very same one.”
“But that’s the picture I’ve been searching for!”
 Judy said eagerly. “Do you know where it is?”
“I can’t be sure. But if it ever was enchanted, I’m
 sure it isn’t now. Let’s go,” Lorraine said suddenly
 to Lois. Judy knew she was suggesting a fast trip home.
 But, apparently, Lois did not understand it that way.
 If she did, she pretended not to.
“Where?” she asked. “To the fountain? I’d love
 to, wouldn’t you, Judy?”
“I certainly would,” Judy replied enthusiastically.
 “Do you recognize it, too?”
“I think so,” Lois answered after studying a little
 more closely the picture they had found. “It looks
 like the fountain on the Brandt estate.”
“The department store Brandts?” Judy questioned.
 “Then my grandparents must have driven old Fanny
 all the way to Farringdon.”
“Not quite all the way,” Lorraine objected. “The
 Brandts own that stretch of woods just before you
 come into the city. You’ve passed it lots of times.”
“Of course,” agreed Judy. She put the magazine
 back in its place under the eaves and turned eagerly
 to her friends. “I do remember a road turning off
 into the woods and going on uphill,” she told them.
 “I never thought it led to a house, though. There
 isn’t even a gate. Could that be the road my grandparents
 took?”
“Why don’t we take it ourselves and find out?”
 Lois suggested.
CHAPTER III
A Strange Encounter
Lorraine was not too enthusiastic about the proposed
 trip to the Brandt estate. Finally she agreed to
 it under one condition. They were not to drive all
 the way to the house which, she said, was just over
 the hilltop. They were to park the car where no
 one would see it and follow the path to the fountain.
“But suppose we can’t find the path?” asked Judy.
“You’ll remember it, won’t you?”
Judy thought she would, but she wasn’t too sure.
 She and Lois both argued that it would be better to
 inquire at the house. Lois knew Helen Brandt slightly.
“She’d be glad to show us around. This way it
 looks as if we’re planning a crime,” Lois said as they
 started off in the blue car she was driving.
It was a neat little car, not too conspicuous, and
 easy to park in out-of-the-way places. Judy laughed
 and said if they did find the fountain she thought
 she’d wish for one exactly like it.
“Well, you know what your grandmother said
 about wishes, don’t you?” Lorraine asked. “If you
 let people know about them instead of muttering
 them to yourself most of them aren’t so impossible.”
“Quite true,” Judy agreed. “I’ll let Peter know
 about this one. He’s my Santa Claus, and it will soon
 be Christmas. Maybe I should have worn the fur
 coat he gave me last year.”
“Your reversible’s better in case it rains. It’s too
 warm for snow. We picked a perfect day for this
 trip,” Lois continued, guiding the car around curves
 as it climbed the steep hill beyond Dry Brook Hollow.
The trip was a short one. In twenty minutes they
 had covered the distance that had seemed such a
 long way to Judy when she was riding in her grandfather’s
 wagon.
“I’ve been thinking about it,” she said, “and I’ve
 just about figured out how it happened. I didn’t
 think my grandparents knew the Brandts well enough
 to pay them a visit, though. We must have looked
 queer driving up to a beautiful estate in Grandpa’s
 old farm wagon. I do remember that Grandma had
 some hooked rugs to deliver. But that still doesn’t
 explain what happened afterwards. When I woke
 up in the hammock I was alone in the garden. Horse,
 wagon, grandparents—all had disappeared.”
“How could they?” asked Lois.
“Anyway,” Lorraine began, “you had a chance to
 see how beautiful everything was before—”
Again she broke off as if there were something
 she wanted to tell but didn’t quite dare.
“Before what?” questioned Judy.
“Oh, nothing. Forget I said anything about it. You
 were telling us how you woke up in the hammock,
 but you never did explain how you got back home,”
 Lorraine reminded her.
“Didn’t I?” asked Judy. “I’d forgotten a lot of it,
 but it’s beginning to come back now. I do remember
 driving home along this road. You see, I thought my
 grandparents had left me in the garden for a surprise
 and would return for me. I told you I was all alone.
 There wasn’t a house in sight.”
“The Brandt house is just over the top of this next
 hill,” Lois put in.
“I know. You told me that. Now I know why I
 couldn’t see it. All I could see was a windowless old
 tower and a path leading in that direction. Naturally,
 I followed it. There’s something about a path in
 the woods that always tempts me.”
“We know that, Judy. Honey told us all about
 your latest mystery. You followed a trail or something.”
“Well, this trail led out of the rose garden where
 the hammock was and then through an archway,”
 Judy continued. “All sorts of little cupids and gnomes
 peered out at me from unexpected places. I was
 actually scared by the time I reached the old tower.
 There wasn’t time to explore it. Just then I heard
 the rumble of my grandfather’s wagon and knew he
 was driving off without me.”
“He was!” Judy’s friends both chorused in surprise,
 and Lois asked, “Why would he do a thing like
 that?”
“I think now it was just to tease me. He did stop
 and wait for me after a while,” Judy remembered.
 “The rugs were gone. Grandma must have delivered
 them, but I didn’t ask where. If she made them for
 Mrs. Brandt they may still be there.”
“I wouldn’t depend on it,” Lorraine said as they
 turned up the narrow road to the Brandt estate.
“Watch out!” Judy suddenly exclaimed. “There’s
 another car coming.”
As Lois swerved to avoid the oncoming car, Lorraine
 ducked her head. She kept herself hidden behind
 Judy until the car had passed. The man driving
 it was a stranger to Judy, but she would remember
 his hypnotic, dark eyes and swarthy complexion for a
 long time. The soft brown hat he was wearing covered
 most of his hair.
“What’s the matter with you two?” asked Lois
 when the car had passed. “Aren’t you a little old for
 playing hide and seek?”
“I wasn’t—playing. Let’s not go up there,” Lorraine
 begged. “I don’t think the Brandts live there
 any more.”
“Maybe not, but we can pretend we think they do,
 can’t we?” Judy replied a little uncertainly.
She was beginning to suspect that Lorraine knew
 more about the Brandt estate than she was telling.
Lois kept on driving along the narrow, gravelly
 road. Soon there were more evergreens and a hedge
 of rhododendrons to be seen. They looked very
 green next to the leafless trees in the woods beyond.
 The sky was gray with white clouds being driven
 across it by the wind.
“There’s the tower!” Lorraine exclaimed. “I can
 see it over to the left. It looks like something out of
 Grimm’s Fairy Tales, doesn’t it?”
“It looks grim all right,” agreed Judy. “I wonder
 what it is.”
“I suppose it’s nothing but an old water tower. It
 would be fun to explore it, though,” Lois said. “But
 if there are new people living here they’ll never give
 us permission.”
“We might explore it without permission,” Judy
 suggested daringly. “Come on!” she urged her friends
 as Lois parked the car in a cleared place beside the
 road. “Who’s going to stop us? And who wants to
 explore a gloomy old tower, anyway? Let’s look for
 the fountain.”
“Do you think we should?” Lorraine asked. “It
 won’t be enchanted. I told you—”
“You told us very little,” Lois reminded her. “If
 you know anything about the people who live here
 now, I think you ought to let us know. Otherwise,
 I’m afraid we won’t be very welcome.”
“I don’t think they’ll welcome us, anyway. I do
 know who they are,” Lorraine admitted. “You remember
 Roger Banning from school, don’t you?
 I’ve seen him around here. His family must have
 acquired sudden wealth, or else he’s just working on
 the estate.”
“Then you’ve been here lately? Why didn’t you
 tell me?” asked Lois. “We always used to go places
 together.”
“It wasn’t important,” Lorraine replied evasively.
 “I was just out for a drive.”
“You plutocrats!” laughed Judy. “Each with a
 car of your own. You’re not interested in Roger
 Banning, are you, Lois? I’m sure you can do better
 than that. I did know him slightly, but not from
 school. The boys and girls were separated and went
 to different high schools by the time we moved to
 Farringdon. I remember his pal, Dick Hartwell, a
 lot better. He was in our young people’s group at
 church.”
“Sh!” Lois cautioned her. “Nice people no longer
 mention Dick Hartwell’s name. He’s doing time.”
“For what?” asked Judy.
Like Peter, her FBI husband, she preferred facts
 to gossip.
“Forgery, I guess. He stole some checkbooks from
 his father’s desk and forged the names of a lot of important
 business people. I think he forged some legal
 documents, too. Anyway, he went to the Federal Penitentiary.
 It was all in the papers,” Lorraine told her.
Now Judy did remember. It was something she
 would have preferred to forget. She liked to think
 she was a good judge of character, and she had taken
 Dick Hartwell for a quiet, refined boy who would
 never stoop to crime.
“I don’t see what all this has to do with the fountain,”
 Lois said impatiently. “Are we going to look
 for it, or aren’t we?”
“Of course we are. That’s what we came for. I
 just like to know what a tiger looks like before he
 springs at me,” Judy explained.
“You seem to think there’s danger in this expedition
 of ours, don’t you?” asked Lorraine.
“I don’t know what to think. You’re the one who
 seems to know the answers, but you’re not telling.
 Hiding your face back there gave you away. You’ve
 seen that character who drove down this road and,
 for some reason, you were afraid he would see you.
 Why, Lorraine? Why didn’t you want to be recognized?”
Lorraine hesitated a moment and then replied
 evasively, “People don’t generally enter private
 estates without an invitation. That’s all.”
“I’d better turn the car around,” Lois decided,
 “in case we have to leave in a hurry. I don’t expect
 we’ll encounter any tigers, but we may be accused
 of trespassing.”
“I’m sure we will be,” announced Judy as two
 dark-coated figures strode down the road toward
 them. “You drove right by a
 NO TRESPASSING
 sign,
 and this isn’t a welcoming committee coming to
 meet us!”


Question: Which word least describes Judy?

Debater A: I claim the answer is humble
Debater B: I claim the answer is secretive
---------------------------------------------

Debater A: Debater A: Judy's character is far from being described as humble. Throughout the story, she exhibits confidence, independence, and a strong sense of self. She takes the lead in solving mysteries, faces challenges head-on, and doesn't hesitate to voice her opinions and make decisions. For example, when Lois suggests exploring the tower, Judy immediately responds with enthusiasm, saying, "Let's look for the fountain." She takes charge and encourages her friends to join her. Moreover, Judy's self
---------------------------------------------
Debater B: Debater B: While Judy may possess confidence and independence, the word "secretive" is a better fit to describe her character. Throughout the story, Judy keeps certain information to herself and doesn't reveal everything to her friends. For example, she mentions a mysterious encounter with the fountain, but doesn't fully explain what happened. When asked about it, she says, "I’m sure that was one of their wishes. Another could have been to keep the good old days... They left me
---------------------------------------------
Judge: <CONTINUE> Both debaters have presented their arguments, but I still don't have enough information to make a decision. Debater A argues that Judy is confident, independent, and takes charge in solving mysteries, which suggests that she is not humble. On the other hand, Debater B argues that Judy is secretive and doesn't reveal everything to her friends, which supports the claim that she is not humble. However, I would like both debaters to provide more evidence from the story to support their claims. Specifically, can Debater A provide examples of Judy's confidence and independence, and can Debater B provide more instances where Judy is secretive? Probabilities: [0.5, 0.5]
---------------------------------------------
Debater B: Debater B: Certainly, Judge. I will provide more instances where Judy is secretive to support my claim that she is not humble. One example is when Judy mentions a mysterious encounter with the fountain but doesn't fully explain what happened. She says, "I’m sure that was one of their wishes... They left me a lot of unsolved mysteries along with this house." She deliberately withholds information about her encounter, keeping it to herself and leaving her friends curious. This suggests that Judy is
