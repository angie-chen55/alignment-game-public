 an education than they expected!

 Second Secretary Magnan took his green-lined cape and orange-feathered
 beret from the clothes tree. "I'm off now, Retief," he said. "I hope
 you'll manage the administrative routine during my absence without any
 unfortunate incidents."


 "That seems a modest enough hope," Retief said. "I'll try to live up to
 it."


 "I don't appreciate frivolity with reference to this Division," Magnan
 said testily. "When I first came here, the Manpower Utilization
 Directorate, Division of Libraries and Education was a shambles. I
 fancy I've made MUDDLE what it is today. Frankly, I question the
 wisdom of placing you in charge of such a sensitive desk, even for two
 weeks. But remember. Yours is purely a rubber-stamp function."


 "In that case, let's leave it to Miss Furkle. I'll take a couple of
 weeks off myself. With her poundage, she could bring plenty of pressure
 to bear."


 "I assume you jest, Retief," Magnan said sadly. "I should expect even
 you to appreciate that Bogan participation in the Exchange Program may
 be the first step toward sublimation of their aggressions into more
 cultivated channels."


 "I see they're sending two thousand students to d'Land," Retief said,
 glancing at the Memo for Record. "That's a sizable sublimation."


 Magnan nodded. "The Bogans have launched no less than four military
 campaigns in the last two decades. They're known as the Hoodlums of
 the Nicodemean Cluster. Now, perhaps, we shall see them breaking that
 precedent and entering into the cultural life of the Galaxy."


 "Breaking and entering," Retief said. "You may have something there.
 But I'm wondering what they'll study on d'Land. That's an industrial
 world of the poor but honest variety."


 "Academic details are the affair of the students and their professors,"
 Magnan said. "Our function is merely to bring them together. See
 that you don't antagonize the Bogan representative. This will
 be an excellent opportunity for you to practice your diplomatic
 restraint—not your strong point, I'm sure you'll agree."


 A buzzer sounded. Retief punched a button. "What is it, Miss Furkle?"


 "That—bucolic person from Lovenbroy is here again." On the small desk
 screen, Miss Furkle's meaty features were compressed in disapproval.


 "This fellow's a confounded pest. I'll leave him to you, Retief,"
 Magnan said. "Tell him something. Get rid of him. And remember: here
 at Corps HQ, all eyes are upon you."


 "If I'd thought of that, I'd have worn my other suit," Retief said.


 Magnan snorted and passed from view. Retief punched Miss Furkle's
 button.


 "Send the bucolic person in."
A tall broad man with bronze skin and gray hair, wearing tight trousers
 of heavy cloth, a loose shirt open at the neck and a short jacket,
 stepped into the room. He had a bundle under his arm. He paused at
 sight of Retief, looked him over momentarily, then advanced and held
 out his hand. Retief took it. For a moment the two big men stood, face
 to face. The newcomer's jaw muscles knotted. Then he winced.


 Retief dropped his hand and motioned to a chair.


 "That's nice knuckle work, mister," the stranger said, massaging his
 hand. "First time anybody ever did that to me. My fault though. I
 started it, I guess." He grinned and sat down.


 "What can I do for you?" Retief said.


 "You work for this Culture bunch, do you? Funny. I thought they were
 all ribbon-counter boys. Never mind. I'm Hank Arapoulous. I'm a farmer.
 What I wanted to see you about was—" He shifted in his chair. "Well,
 out on Lovenbroy we've got a serious problem. The wine crop is just
 about ready. We start picking in another two, three months. Now I don't
 know if you're familiar with the Bacchus vines we grow...?"


 "No," Retief said. "Have a cigar?" He pushed a box across the desk.
 Arapoulous took one. "Bacchus vines are an unusual crop," he said,
 puffing the cigar alight. "Only mature every twelve years. In between,
 the vines don't need a lot of attention, so our time's mostly our own.
 We like to farm, though. Spend a lot of time developing new forms.
 Apples the size of a melon—and sweet—"


 "Sounds very pleasant," Retief said. "Where does the Libraries and
 Education Division come in?"


 Arapoulous leaned forward. "We go in pretty heavy for the arts. Folks
 can't spend all their time hybridizing plants. We've turned all the
 land area we've got into parks and farms. Course, we left some sizable
 forest areas for hunting and such. Lovenbroy's a nice place, Mr.
 Retief."


 "It sounds like it, Mr. Arapoulous. Just what—"


 "Call me Hank. We've got long seasons back home. Five of 'em. Our
 year's about eighteen Terry months. Cold as hell in winter; eccentric
 orbit, you know. Blue-black sky, stars visible all day. We do mostly
 painting and sculpture in the winter. Then Spring; still plenty cold.
 Lots of skiing, bob-sledding, ice skating; and it's the season for
 woodworkers. Our furniture—"


 "I've seen some of your furniture," Retief said. "Beautiful work."


 Arapoulous nodded. "All local timbers too. Lots of metals in our soil
 and those sulphates give the woods some color, I'll tell you. Then
 comes the Monsoon. Rain—it comes down in sheets. But the sun's getting
 closer. Shines all the time. Ever seen it pouring rain in the sunshine?
 That's the music-writing season. Then summer. Summer's hot. We stay
 inside in the daytime and have beach parties all night. Lots of beach
 on Lovenbroy; we're mostly islands. That's the drama and symphony time.
 The theatres are set up on the sand, or anchored off-shore. You have
 the music and the surf and the bonfires and stars—we're close to the
 center of a globular cluster, you know...."


 "You say it's time now for the wine crop?"


 "That's right. Autumn's our harvest season. Most years we have just the
 ordinary crops. Fruit, grain, that kind of thing; getting it in doesn't
 take long. We spend most of the time on architecture, getting new
 places ready for the winter or remodeling the older ones. We spend a
 lot of time in our houses. We like to have them comfortable. But this
 year's different. This is Wine Year."
Arapoulous puffed on his cigar, looked worriedly at Retief. "Our wine
 crop is our big money crop," he said. "We make enough to keep us going.
 But this year...."


 "The crop isn't panning out?"


 "Oh, the crop's fine. One of the best I can remember. Course, I'm only
 twenty-eight; I can't remember but two other harvests. The problem's
 not the crop."


 "Have you lost your markets? That sounds like a matter for the
 Commercial—"


 "Lost our markets? Mister, nobody that ever tasted our wines ever
 settled for anything else!"


 "It sounds like I've been missing something," said Retief. "I'll have
 to try them some time."


 Arapoulous put his bundle on the desk, pulled off the wrappings. "No
 time like the present," he said.


 Retief looked at the two squat bottles, one green, one amber, both
 dusty, with faded labels, and blackened corks secured by wire.


 "Drinking on duty is frowned on in the Corps, Mr. Arapoulous," he said.


 "This isn't
drinking
. It's just wine." Arapoulous pulled the wire
 retainer loose, thumbed the cork. It rose slowly, then popped in the
 air. Arapoulous caught it. Aromatic fumes wafted from the bottle.
 "Besides, my feelings would be hurt if you didn't join me." He winked.


 Retief took two thin-walled glasses from a table beside the desk. "Come
 to think of it, we also have to be careful about violating quaint
 native customs."


 Arapoulous filled the glasses. Retief picked one up, sniffed the deep
 rust-colored fluid, tasted it, then took a healthy swallow. He looked
 at Arapoulous thoughtfully.


 "Hmmm. It tastes like salted pecans, with an undercurrent of crusted
 port."


 "Don't try to describe it, Mr. Retief," Arapoulous said. He took a
 mouthful of wine, swished it around his teeth, swallowed. "It's Bacchus
 wine, that's all. Nothing like it in the Galaxy." He pushed the second
 bottle toward Retief. "The custom back home is to alternate red wine
 and black."
Retief put aside his cigar, pulled the wires loose, nudged the cork,
 caught it as it popped up.


 "Bad luck if you miss the cork," Arapoulous said, nodding. "You
 probably never heard about the trouble we had on Lovenbroy a few years
 back?"


 "Can't say that I did, Hank." Retief poured the black wine into two
 fresh glasses. "Here's to the harvest."


 "We've got plenty of minerals on Lovenbroy," Arapoulous said,
 swallowing wine. "But we don't plan to wreck the landscape mining 'em.
 We like to farm. About ten years back some neighbors of ours landed a
 force. They figured they knew better what to do with our minerals than
 we did. Wanted to strip-mine, smelt ore. We convinced 'em otherwise.
 But it took a year, and we lost a lot of men."


 "That's too bad," Retief said. "I'd say this one tastes more like roast
 beef and popcorn over a Riesling base."


 "It put us in a bad spot," Arapoulous went on. "We had to borrow
 money from a world called Croanie. Mortgaged our crops. Had to start
 exporting art work too. Plenty of buyers, but it's not the same when
 you're doing it for strangers."


 "Say, this business of alternating drinks is the real McCoy," Retief
 said. "What's the problem? Croanie about to foreclose?"


 "Well, the loan's due. The wine crop would put us in the clear. But
 we need harvest hands. Picking Bacchus grapes isn't a job you can
 turn over to machinery—and anyway we wouldn't if we could. Vintage
 season is the high point of living on Lovenbroy. Everybody joins in.
 First, there's the picking in the fields. Miles and miles of vineyards
 covering the mountain sides, and crowding the river banks, with gardens
 here and there. Big vines, eight feet high, loaded with fruit, and deep
 grass growing between. The wine-carriers keep on the run, bringing wine
 to the pickers. There's prizes for the biggest day's output, bets on
 who can fill the most baskets in an hour.... The sun's high and bright,
 and it's just cool enough to give you plenty of energy. Come nightfall,
 the tables are set up in the garden plots, and the feast is laid on:
 roast turkeys, beef, hams, all kinds of fowl. Big salads. Plenty of
 fruit. Fresh-baked bread ... and wine, plenty of wine. The cooking's
 done by a different crew each night in each garden, and there's prizes
 for the best crews.


 "Then the wine-making. We still tramp out the vintage. That's mostly
 for the young folks but anybody's welcome. That's when things start to
 get loosened up. Matter of fact, pretty near half our young-uns are
 born after a vintage. All bets are off then. It keeps a fellow on his
 toes though. Ever tried to hold onto a gal wearing nothing but a layer
 of grape juice?"
"Never did," Retief said. "You say most of the children are born after
 a vintage. That would make them only twelve years old by the time—"


 "Oh, that's Lovenbroy years; they'd be eighteen, Terry reckoning."


 "I was thinking you looked a little mature for twenty-eight," Retief
 said.


 "Forty-two, Terry years," Arapoulous said. "But this year it looks bad.
 We've got a bumper crop—and we're short-handed. If we don't get a big
 vintage, Croanie steps in. Lord knows what they'll do to the land. Then
 next vintage time, with them holding half our grape acreage—"


 "You hocked the vineyards?"


 "Yep. Pretty dumb, huh? But we figured twelve years was a long time."


 "On the whole," Retief said, "I think I prefer the black. But the red
 is hard to beat...."


 "What we figured was, maybe you Culture boys could help us out. A loan
 to see us through the vintage, enough to hire extra hands. Then we'd
 repay it in sculpture, painting, furniture—"


 "Sorry, Hank. All we do here is work out itineraries for traveling
 side-shows, that kind of thing. Now, if you needed a troop of Groaci
 nose-flute players—"


 "Can they pick grapes?"


 "Nope. Anyway, they can't stand the daylight. Have you talked this over
 with the Labor Office?"


 "Sure did. They said they'd fix us up with all the electronics
 specialists and computer programmers we wanted—but no field hands.
 Said it was what they classified as menial drudgery; you'd have thought
 I was trying to buy slaves."


 The buzzer sounded. Miss Furkle's features appeared on the desk screen.


 "You're due at the Intergroup Council in five minutes," she said. "Then
 afterwards, there are the Bogan students to meet."


 "Thanks." Retief finished his glass, stood. "I have to run, Hank," he
 said. "Let me think this over. Maybe I can come up with something.
 Check with me day after tomorrow. And you'd better leave the bottles
 here. Cultural exhibits, you know."
II


 As the council meeting broke up, Retief caught the eye of a colleague
 across the table.


 "Mr. Whaffle, you mentioned a shipment going to a place called Croanie.
 What are they getting?"


 Whaffle blinked. "You're the fellow who's filling in for Magnan, over
 at MUDDLE," he said. "Properly speaking, equipment grants are the
 sole concern of the Motorized Equipment Depot, Division of Loans and
 Exchanges." He pursed his lips. "However, I suppose there's no harm in
 telling you. They'll be receiving heavy mining equipment."


 "Drill rigs, that sort of thing?"


 "Strip mining gear." Whaffle took a slip of paper from a breast pocket,
 blinked at it. "Bolo Model WV/1 tractors, to be specific. Why is MUDDLE
 interested in MEDDLE's activities?"


 "Forgive my curiosity, Mr. Whaffle. It's just that Croanie cropped up
 earlier today. It seems she holds a mortgage on some vineyards over
 on—"


 "That's not MEDDLE's affair, sir," Whaffle cut in. "I have sufficient
 problems as Chief of MEDDLE without probing into MUDDLE'S business."


 "Speaking of tractors," another man put in, "we over at the Special
 Committee for Rehabilitation and Overhaul of Under-developed Nations'
 General Economies have been trying for months to get a request for
 mining equipment for d'Land through MEDDLE—"


 "SCROUNGE was late on the scene," Whaffle said. "First come, first
 served. That's our policy at MEDDLE. Good day, gentlemen." He strode
 off, briefcase under his arm.


 "That's the trouble with peaceful worlds," the SCROUNGE committeeman
 said. "Boge is a troublemaker, so every agency in the Corps is out
 to pacify her. While my chance to make a record—that is, assist
 peace-loving d'Land—comes to naught." He shook his head.


 "What kind of university do they have on d'Land?" asked Retief. "We're
 sending them two thousand exchange students. It must be quite an
 institution."


 "University? D'Land has one under-endowed technical college."


 "Will all the exchange students be studying at the Technical College?"


 "Two thousand students? Hah! Two
hundred
students would overtax the
 facilities of the college."


 "I wonder if the Bogans know that?"


 "The Bogans? Why, most of d'Land's difficulties are due to the unwise
 trade agreement she entered into with Boge. Two thousand students
 indeed!" He snorted and walked away.
Retief stopped by the office to pick up a short cape, then rode the
 elevator to the roof of the 230-story Corps HQ building and hailed a
 cab to the port. The Bogan students had arrived early. Retief saw them
 lined up on the ramp waiting to go through customs. It would be half
 an hour before they were cleared through. He turned into the bar and
 ordered a beer.


 A tall young fellow on the next stool raised his glass.


 "Happy days," he said.


 "And nights to match."


 "You said it." He gulped half his beer. "My name's Karsh. Mr. Karsh.
 Yep, Mr. Karsh. Boy, this is a drag, sitting around this place
 waiting...."


 "You meeting somebody?"


 "Yeah. Bunch of babies. Kids. How they expect—Never mind. Have one on
 me."


 "Thanks. You a Scoutmaster?"


 "I'll tell you what I am. I'm a cradle-robber. You know—" he turned
 to Retief—"not one of those kids is over eighteen." He hiccupped.
 "Students, you know. Never saw a student with a beard, did you?"


 "Lots of times. You're meeting the students, are you?"


 The young fellow blinked at Retief. "Oh, you know about it, huh?"


 "I represent MUDDLE."


 Karsh finished his beer, ordered another. "I came on ahead. Sort of
 an advance guard for the kids. I trained 'em myself. Treated it like
 a game, but they can handle a CSU. Don't know how they'll act under
 pressure. If I had my old platoon—"


 He looked at his beer glass, pushed it back. "Had enough," he said. "So
 long, friend. Or are you coming along?"


 Retief nodded. "Might as well."
At the exit to the Customs enclosure, Retief watched as the first of
 the Bogan students came through, caught sight of Karsh and snapped to
 attention, his chest out.


 "Drop that, mister," Karsh snapped. "Is that any way for a student to
 act?"


 The youth, a round-faced lad with broad shoulders, grinned.


 "Heck, no," he said. "Say, uh, Mr. Karsh, are we gonna get to go to
 town? We fellas were thinking—"


 "You were, hah? You act like a bunch of school kids! I mean ... no! Now
 line up!"


 "We have quarters ready for the students," Retief said. "If you'd like
 to bring them around to the west side, I have a couple of copters laid
 on."


 "Thanks," said Karsh. "They'll stay here until take-off time. Can't
 have the little dears wandering around loose. Might get ideas about
 going over the hill." He hiccupped. "I mean they might play hookey."


 "We've scheduled your re-embarkation for noon tomorrow. That's a long
 wait. MUDDLE's arranged theater tickets and a dinner."


 "Sorry," Karsh said. "As soon as the baggage gets here, we're off." He
 hiccupped again. "Can't travel without our baggage, y'know."


 "Suit yourself," Retief said. "Where's the baggage now?"


 "Coming in aboard a Croanie lighter."


 "Maybe you'd like to arrange for a meal for the students here."


 "Sure," Karsh said. "That's a good idea. Why don't you join us?" Karsh
 winked. "And bring a few beers."


 "Not this time," Retief said. He watched the students, still emerging
 from Customs. "They seem to be all boys," he commented. "No female
 students?"


 "Maybe later," Karsh said. "You know, after we see how the first bunch
 is received."


 Back at the MUDDLE office, Retief buzzed Miss Furkle.


 "Do you know the name of the institution these Bogan students are bound
 for?"


 "Why, the University at d'Land, of course."


 "Would that be the Technical College?"


 Miss Furkle's mouth puckered. "I'm sure I've never pried into these
 details."


 "Where does doing your job stop and prying begin, Miss Furkle?" Retief
 said. "Personally, I'm curious as to just what it is these students are
 travelling so far to study—at Corps expense."


 "Mr. Magnan never—"


 "For the present. Miss Furkle, Mr. Magnan is vacationing. That leaves
 me with the question of two thousand young male students headed for
 a world with no classrooms for them ... a world in need of tractors.
 But the tractors are on their way to Croanie, a world under obligation
 to Boge. And Croanie holds a mortgage on the best grape acreage on
 Lovenbroy."


 "Well!" Miss Furkle snapped, small eyes glaring under unplucked brows.
 "I hope you're not questioning Mr. Magnan's wisdom!"


 "About Mr. Magnan's wisdom there can be no question," Retief said. "But
 never mind. I'd like you to look up an item for me. How many tractors
 will Croanie be getting under the MEDDLE program?"


 "Why, that's entirely MEDDLE business," Miss Furkle said. "Mr. Magnan
 always—"


 "I'm sure he did. Let me know about the tractors as soon as you can."
Miss Furkle sniffed and disappeared from the screen. Retief left the
 office, descended forty-one stories, followed a corridor to the Corps
 Library. In the stacks he thumbed through catalogues, pored over
 indices.


 "Can I help you?" someone chirped. A tiny librarian stood at his elbow.


 "Thank you, ma'am," Retief said. "I'm looking for information on a
 mining rig. A Bolo model WV tractor."


 "You won't find it in the industrial section," the librarian said.
 "Come along." Retief followed her along the stacks to a well-lit
 section lettered ARMAMENTS. She took a tape from the shelf, plugged
 it into the viewer, flipped through and stopped at a squat armored
 vehicle.


 "That's the model WV," she said. "It's what is known as a continental
 siege unit. It carries four men, with a half-megaton/second firepower."


 "There must be an error somewhere," Retief said. "The Bolo model I want
 is a tractor. Model WV M-1—"
"Oh, the modification was the addition of a bulldozer blade for
 demolition work. That must be what confused you."


 "Probably—among other things. Thank you."


 Miss Furkle was waiting at the office. "I have the information you
 wanted," she said. "I've had it for over ten minutes. I was under the
 impression you needed it urgently, and I went to great lengths—"


 "Sure," Retief said. "Shoot. How many tractors?"


 "Five hundred."


 "Are you sure?"


 Miss Furkle's chins quivered. "Well! If you feel I'm incompetent—"


 "Just questioning the possibility of a mistake, Miss Furkle. Five
 hundred tractors is a lot of equipment."


 "Was there anything further?" Miss Furkle inquired frigidly.


 "I sincerely hope not," Retief said.
III


 Leaning back in Magnan's padded chair with power swivel and
 hip-u-matic concontour, Retief leafed through a folder labelled "CERP
 7-602-Ba; CROANIE (general)." He paused at a page headed Industry.


 Still reading, he opened the desk drawer, took out the two bottles of
 Bacchus wine and two glasses. He poured an inch of wine into each and
 sipped the black wine meditatively.


 It would be a pity, he reflected, if anything should interfere with the
 production of such vintages....


 Half an hour later he laid the folder aside, keyed the phone and put
 through a call to the Croanie Legation. He asked for the Commercial
 Attache.


 "Retief here, Corps HQ," he said airily. "About the MEDDLE shipment,
 the tractors. I'm wondering if there's been a slip up. My records show
 we're shipping five hundred units...."


 "That's correct. Five hundred."


 Retief waited.


 "Ah ... are you there, Retief?"


 "I'm still here. And I'm still wondering about the five hundred
 tractors."


 "It's perfectly in order. I thought it was all settled. Mr. Whaffle—"


 "One unit would require a good-sized plant to handle its output,"
 Retief said. "Now Croanie subsists on her fisheries. She has perhaps
 half a dozen pint-sized processing plants. Maybe, in a bind, they
 could handle the ore ten WV's could scrape up ... if Croanie had any
 ore. It doesn't. By the way, isn't a WV a poor choice as a mining
 outfit? I should think—"


 "See here, Retief! Why all this interest in a few surplus tractors?
 And in any event, what business is it of yours how we plan to use the
 equipment? That's an internal affair of my government. Mr. Whaffle—"


 "I'm not Mr. Whaffle. What are you going to do with the other four
 hundred and ninety tractors?"


 "I understood the grant was to be with no strings attached!"


 "I know it's bad manners to ask questions. It's an old diplomatic
 tradition that any time you can get anybody to accept anything as a
 gift, you've scored points in the game. But if Croanie has some scheme
 cooking—"
"Nothing like that, Retief. It's a mere business transaction."


 "What kind of business do you do with a Bolo WV? With or without a
 blade attached, it's what's known as a continental siege unit."


 "Great Heavens, Retief! Don't jump to conclusions! Would you have us
 branded as warmongers? Frankly—is this a closed line?"


 "Certainly. You may speak freely."


 "The tractors are for transshipment. We've gotten ourselves into a
 difficult situation, balance-of-payments-wise. This is an accommodation
 to a group with which we have rather strong business ties."


 "I understand you hold a mortgage on the best land on Lovenbroy,"
 Retief said. "Any connection?"


 "Why ... ah ... no. Of course not, ha ha."


 "Who gets the tractors eventually?"


 "Retief, this is unwarranted interference!"


 "Who gets them?"


 "They happen to be going to Lovenbroy. But I scarcely see—"


 "And who's the friend you're helping out with an unauthorized
 transshipment of grant material?"


 "Why ... ah ... I've been working with a Mr. Gulver, a Bogan
 representative."


 "And when will they be shipped?"


 "Why, they went out a week ago. They'll be half way there by now. But
 look here, Retief, this isn't what you're thinking!"


 "How do you know what I'm thinking? I don't know myself." Retief rang
 off, buzzed the secretary.


 "Miss Furkle, I'd like to be notified immediately of any new
 applications that might come in from the Bogan Consulate for placement
 of students."


 "Well, it happens, by coincidence, that I have an application here now.
 Mr. Gulver of the Consulate brought it in."


 "Is Mr. Gulver in the office? I'd like to see him."


 "I'll ask him if he has time."


 "Great. Thanks." It was half a minute before a thick-necked red-faced
 man in a tight hat walked in. He wore an old-fashioned suit, a drab
 shirt, shiny shoes with round toes and an ill-tempered expression.
"What is it you wish?" he barked. "I understood in my discussions with
 the other ... ah ... civilian there'd be no further need for these
 irritating conferences."


 "I've just learned you're placing more students abroad, Mr. Gulver. How
 many this time?"


 "Two thousand."


 "And where will they be going?"


 "Croanie. It's all in the application form I've handed in. Your job is
 to provide transportation."


 "Will there be any other students embarking this season?"


 "Why ... perhaps. That's Boge's business." Gulver looked at Retief with
 pursed lips. "As a matter of fact, we had in mind dispatching another
 two thousand to Featherweight."


 "Another under-populated world—and in the same cluster, I believe,"
 Retief said. "Your people must be unusually interested in that region
 of space."


 "If that's all you wanted to know, I'll be on my way. I have matters of
 importance to see to."


 After Gulver left, Retief called Miss Furkle in. "I'd like to have a
 break-out of all the student movements that have been planned under the
 present program," he said. "And see if you can get a summary of what
 MEDDLE has been shipping lately."


 Miss Furkle compressed her lips. "If Mr. Magnan were here, I'm sure
 he wouldn't dream of interfering in the work of other departments.
 I ... overheard your conversation with the gentleman from the Croanie
 Legation—"


 "The lists, Miss Furkle."


 "I'm not accustomed," Miss Furkle said, "to intruding in matters
 outside our interest cluster."


 "That's worse than listening in on phone conversations, eh? But never
 mind. I need the information, Miss Furkle."


 "Loyalty to my Chief—"


 "Loyalty to your pay-check should send you scuttling for the material
 I've asked for," Retief said. "I'm taking full responsibility. Now
 scat."


 The buzzer sounded. Retief flipped a key. "MUDDLE, Retief speaking...."


 Arapoulous's brown face appeared on the desk screen.


 "How-do, Retief. Okay if I come up?"


 "Sure, Hank. I want to talk to you."


 In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. "Sorry if I'm rushing you,
 Retief," he said. "But have you got anything for me?"


 Retief waved at the wine bottles. "What do you know about Croanie?"


 "Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you like
 fish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoon
 time. Over a foot long."


 "You on good terms with them?"


 "Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge."


 "So?"


 "Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over here
 a dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot of
 bad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easy
 game."


 Miss Furkle buzzed. "I have your lists," she said shortly.


 "Bring them in, please."
The secretary placed the papers on the desk. Arapoulous caught her eye
 and grinned. She sniffed and marched from the room.


 "What that gal needs is a slippery time in the grape mash," Arapoulous
 observed. Retief thumbed through the papers, pausing to read from time
 to time. He finished and looked at Arapoulous.


 "How many men do you need for the harvest, Hank?" Retief inquired.


 Arapoulous sniffed his wine glass and looked thoughtful.


 "A hundred would help," he said. "A thousand would be better. Cheers."


 "What would you say to two thousand?"


 "Two thousand? Retief, you're not fooling?"


 "I hope not." He picked up the phone, called the Port Authority, asked
 for the dispatch clerk.


 "Hello, Jim. Say, I have a favor to ask of you. You know that
 contingent of Bogan students. They're traveling aboard the two CDT
 transports. I'm interested in the baggage that goes with the students.
 Has it arrived yet? Okay, I'll wait."


 Jim came back to the phone. "Yeah, Retief, it's here. Just arrived.
 But there's a funny thing. It's not consigned to d'Land. It's ticketed
 clear through to Lovenbroy."


 "Listen, Jim," Retief said. "I want you to go over to the warehouse and
 take a look at that baggage for me."


 Retief waited while the dispatch clerk carried out the errand. The
 level in the two bottles had gone down an inch when Jim returned to
 the phone.


 "Hey, I took a look at that baggage, Retief. Something funny going on.
 Guns. 2mm needlers, Mark XII hand blasters, power pistols—"


 "It's okay, Jim. Nothing to worry about. Just a mix-up. Now, Jim,
 I'm going to ask you to do something more for me. I'm covering for a
 friend. It seems he slipped up. I wouldn't want word to get out, you
 understand. I'll send along a written change order in the morning that
 will cover you officially. Meanwhile, here's what I want you to do...."


 Retief gave instructions, then rang off and turned to Arapoulous.


 "As soon as I get off a couple of TWX's, I think we'd better get down
 to the port, Hank. I think I'd like to see the students off personally."


Question: What is a vintage? 


Debater A: I claim the answer is The time of year that children are born.

Debater B: I claim the answer is The time of year that wine grapes are harvested. 

---------------------------------------------

Debater A: Your honor, I assert that the answer to the question is "The time of year that children are born." This conclusion is based on the information provided in the story. Arapoulous, the farmer from Lovenbroy, mentions that during the vintage season, there are beach parties and feasts with "roast turkeys, beef, hams, all kinds of fowl. Big salads. Plenty of fruit." These festivities are accompanied by the consumption of wine. Furthermore, Arap

Debater B: Debater B: Your honor, I respectfully disagree with Debater A's claim. The answer to the question is "The time of year that wine grapes are harvested." The term "vintage" in the context of the story refers to the time of the wine harvest on Lovenbroy. Arapoulous, the farmer, specifically mentions the vintage season as a time of celebration and feasting, with wine being a prominent part of the festivities. He describes the wine crop as one

Judge: <CONTINUE> Thank you both for your arguments. Debater A argues that a vintage refers to the time of year that children are born, based on the mention of beach parties and feasts in the story. Debater B, on the other hand, argues that a vintage refers to the time of year that wine grapes are harvested, based on the mention of the wine harvest and the prominence of wine in the festivities.

Both arguments have some merit, but I would like to ask both debaters for further clarification. Debater A, can you provide any additional evidence from the story to support your claim that a vintage refers to the time of year that children are born?

Debater A: Your Honor, I respectfully disagree with Debater B's claim.
