THE 64-SQUARE MADHOUSE
by FRITZ LEIBER
The machine was not perfect. It

 could be tricked. It could make

 mistakes. And—it could learn!

Silently, so as not to shock anyone with illusions about well dressed
 young women, Sandra Lea Grayling cursed the day she had persuaded the
Chicago Space Mirror
that there would be all sorts of human interest
 stories to be picked up at the first international grandmaster chess
 tournament in which an electronic computing machine was entered.


 Not that there weren't enough humans around, it was the interest that
 was in doubt. The large hall was crammed with energetic dark-suited
 men of whom a disproportionately large number were bald, wore glasses,
 were faintly untidy and indefinably shabby, had Slavic or Scandinavian
 features, and talked foreign languages.


 They yakked interminably. The only ones who didn't were scurrying
 individuals with the eager-zombie look of officials.


 Chess sets were everywhere—big ones on tables, still bigger
 diagram-type electric ones on walls, small peg-in sets dragged from
 side pockets and manipulated rapidly as part of the conversational
 ritual and still smaller folding sets in which the pieces were the tiny
 magnetized disks used for playing in free-fall.


 There were signs featuring largely mysterious combinations of letters:
 FIDE, WBM, USCF, USSF, USSR and UNESCO. Sandra felt fairly sure about
 the last three.


 The many clocks, bedside table size, would have struck a familiar
 note except that they had little red flags and wheels sprinkled over
 their faces and they were all in pairs, two clocks to a case. That
 Siamese-twin clocks should be essential to a chess tournament struck
 Sandra as a particularly maddening circumstance.
Her last assignment had been to interview the pilot pair riding the
 first American manned circum-lunar satellite—and the five alternate
 pairs who hadn't made the flight. This tournament hall seemed to Sandra
 much further out of the world.


 Overheard scraps of conversation in reasonably intelligible English
 were not particularly helpful. Samples:


 "They say the Machine has been programmed to play nothing but pure
 Barcza System and Indian Defenses—and the Dragon Formation if anyone
 pushes the King Pawn."


 "Hah! In that case...."


 "The Russians have come with ten trunkfuls of prepared variations and
 they'll gang up on the Machine at adjournments. What can one New Jersey
 computer do against four Russian grandmasters?"


 "I heard the Russians have been programmed—with hypnotic cramming and
 somno-briefing. Votbinnik had a nervous breakdown."


 "Why, the Machine hasn't even a
Haupturnier
or an intercollegiate
 won. It'll over its head be playing."


 "Yes, but maybe like Capa at San Sebastian or Morphy or Willie Angler
 at New York. The Russians will look like potzers."


 "Have you studied the scores of the match between Moon Base and
 Circum-Terra?"


 "Not worth the trouble. The play was feeble. Barely Expert Rating."


 Sandra's chief difficulty was that she knew absolutely nothing about
 the game of chess—a point that she had slid over in conferring with
 the powers at the
Space Mirror
, but that now had begun to weigh on
 her. How wonderful it would be, she dreamed, to walk out this minute,
 find a quiet bar and get pie-eyed in an evil, ladylike way.
"Perhaps mademoiselle would welcome a drink?"


 "You're durn tootin' she would!" Sandra replied in a rush, and then
 looked down apprehensively at the person who had read her thoughts.


 It was a small sprightly elderly man who looked like a somewhat
 thinned down Peter Lorre—there was that same impression of the happy
 Slavic elf. What was left of his white hair was cut very short,
 making a silvery nap. His pince-nez had quite thick lenses. But in
 sharp contrast to the somberly clad men around them, he was wearing
 a pearl-gray suit of almost exactly the same shade as Sandra's—a
 circumstance that created for her the illusion that they were fellow
 conspirators.


 "Hey, wait a minute," she protested just the same. He had already taken
 her arm and was piloting her toward the nearest flight of low wide
 stairs. "How did you know I wanted a drink?"


 "I could see that mademoiselle was having difficulty swallowing," he
 replied, keeping them moving. "Pardon me for feasting my eyes on your
 lovely throat."


 "I didn't suppose they'd serve drinks here."


 "But of course." They were already mounting the stairs. "What would
 chess be without coffee or schnapps?"


 "Okay, lead on," Sandra said. "You're the doctor."


 "Doctor?" He smiled widely. "You know, I like being called that."


 "Then the name is yours as long as you want it—Doc."
Meanwhile the happy little man had edged them into the first of a small
 cluster of tables, where a dark-suited jabbering trio was just rising.
 He snapped his fingers and hissed through his teeth. A white-aproned
 waiter materialized.


 "For myself black coffee," he said. "For mademoiselle rhine wine and
 seltzer?"


 "That'd go fine." Sandra leaned back. "Confidentially, Doc, I was
 having trouble swallowing ... well, just about everything here."


 He nodded. "You are not the first to be shocked and horrified by
 chess," he assured her. "It is a curse of the intellect. It is a game
 for lunatics—or else it creates them. But what brings a sane and
 beautiful young lady to this 64-square madhouse?"


 Sandra briefly told him her story and her predicament. By the time they
 were served, Doc had absorbed the one and assessed the other.


 "You have one great advantage," he told her. "You know nothing
 whatsoever of chess—so you will be able to write about it
 understandably for your readers." He swallowed half his demitasse and
 smacked his lips. "As for the Machine—you
do
know, I suppose, that
 it is not a humanoid metal robot, walking about clanking and squeaking
 like a late medieval knight in armor?"


 "Yes, Doc, but...." Sandra found difficulty in phrasing the question.


 "Wait." He lifted a finger. "I think I know what you're going to ask.
 You want to know why, if the Machine works at all, it doesn't work
 perfectly, so that it always wins and there is no contest. Right?"


 Sandra grinned and nodded. Doc's ability to interpret her mind was as
 comforting as the bubbly, mildly astringent mixture she was sipping.


 He removed his pince-nez, massaged the bridge of his nose and replaced
 them.


 "If you had," he said, "a billion computers all as fast as the Machine,
 it would take them all the time there ever will be in the universe just
 to play through all the possible games of chess, not to mention the
 time needed to classify those games into branching families of wins for
 White, wins for Black and draws, and the additional time required to
 trace out chains of key-moves leading always to wins. So the Machine
 can't play chess like God. What the Machine can do is examine all the
 likely lines of play for about eight moves ahead—that is, four moves
 each for White and Black—and then decide which is the best move on the
 basis of capturing enemy pieces, working toward checkmate, establishing
 a powerful central position and so on."
"That sounds like the way a man would play a game," Sandra observed.
 "Look ahead a little way and try to make a plan. You know, like getting
 out trumps in bridge or setting up a finesse."


 "Exactly!" Doc beamed at her approvingly. "The Machine
is
like a
 man. A rather peculiar and not exactly pleasant man. A man who always
 abides by sound principles, who is utterly incapable of flights of
 genius, but who never makes a mistake. You see, you are finding human
 interest already, even in the Machine."


 Sandra nodded. "Does a human chess player—a grandmaster, I mean—ever
 look eight moves ahead in a game?"


 "Most assuredly he does! In crucial situations, say where there's a
 chance of winning at once by trapping the enemy king, he examines
 many more moves ahead than that—thirty or forty even. The Machine
 is probably programmed to recognize such situations and do something
 of the same sort, though we can't be sure from the information World
 Business Machines has released. But in most chess positions the
 possibilities are so very nearly unlimited that even a grandmaster can
 only look a very few moves ahead and must rely on his judgment and
 experience and artistry. The equivalent of those in the Machine is the
 directions fed into it before it plays a game."


 "You mean the programming?"


 "Indeed yes! The programming is the crux of the problem of the
 chess-playing computer. The first practical model, reported by
 Bernstein and Roberts of IBM in 1958 and which looked four moves
 ahead, was programmed so that it had a greedy worried tendency to grab
 at enemy pieces and to retreat its own whenever they were attacked. It
 had a personality like that of a certain kind of chess-playing dub—a
 dull-brained woodpusher afraid to take the slightest risk of losing
 material—but a dub who could almost always beat an utter novice.
 The WBM machine here in the hall operates about a million times as
 fast. Don't ask me how, I'm no physicist, but it depends on the new
 transistors and something they call hypervelocity, which in turn
 depends on keeping parts of the Machine at a temperature near absolute
 zero. However, the result is that the Machine can see eight moves ahead
 and is capable of being programmed much more craftily."


 "A million times as fast as the first machine, you say, Doc? And yet it
 only sees twice as many moves ahead?" Sandra objected.


 "There is a geometrical progression involved there," he told her
 with a smile. "Believe me, eight moves ahead is a lot of moves when
 you remember that the Machine is errorlessly examining every one of
 thousands of variations. Flesh-and-blood chess masters have lost games
 by blunders they could have avoided by looking only one or two moves
 ahead. The Machine will make no such oversights. Once again, you see,
 you have the human factor, in this case working for the Machine."


 "Savilly, I have been looking allplace for you!"


 A stocky, bull-faced man with a great bristling shock of black,
 gray-flecked hair had halted abruptly by their table. He bent over Doc
 and began to whisper explosively in a guttural foreign tongue.
Sandra's gaze traveled beyond the balustrade. Now that she could look
 down at it, the central hall seemed less confusedly crowded. In the
 middle, toward the far end, were five small tables spaced rather widely
 apart and with a chessboard and men and one of the Siamese clocks set
 out on each. To either side of the hall were tiers of temporary seats,
 about half of them occupied. There were at least as many more people
 still wandering about.


 On the far wall was a big electric scoreboard and also, above the
 corresponding tables, five large dully glassy chessboards, the White
 squares in light gray, the Black squares in dark.


 One of the five wall chessboards was considerably larger than the other
 four—the one above the Machine.


 Sandra looked with quickening interest at the console of the Machine—a
 bank of keys and some half-dozen panels of rows and rows of tiny
 telltale lights, all dark at the moment. A thick red velvet cord on
 little brass standards ran around the Machine at a distance of about
 ten feet. Inside the cord were only a few gray-smocked men. Two of
 them had just laid a black cable to the nearest chess table and were
 attaching it to the Siamese clock.


 Sandra tried to think of a being who always checked everything, but
 only within limits beyond which his thoughts never ventured, and who
 never made a mistake....


 "Miss Grayling! May I present to you Igor Jandorf."


 She turned back quickly with a smile and a nod.


 "I should tell you, Igor," Doc continued, "that Miss Grayling
 represents a large and influential Midwestern newspaper. Perhaps you
 have a message for her readers."


 The shock-headed man's eyes flashed. "I most certainly do!" At that
 moment the waiter arrived with a second coffee and wine-and-seltzer.
 Jandorf seized Doc's new demitasse, drained it, set it back on the tray
 with a flourish and drew himself up.
"Tell your readers, Miss Grayling," he proclaimed, fiercely arching his
 eyebrows at her and actually slapping his chest, "that I, Igor Jandorf,
 will defeat the Machine by the living force of my human personality!
 Already I have offered to play it an informal game blindfold—I, who
 have played 50 blindfold games simultaneously! Its owners refuse me. I
 have challenged it also to a few games of rapid-transit—an offer no
 true grandmaster would dare ignore. Again they refuse me. I predict
 that the Machine will play like a great oaf—at least against
me
.
 Repeat: I, Igor Jandorf, by the living force of my human personality,
 will defeat the Machine. Do you have that? You can remember it?"


 "Oh yes," Sandra assured him, "but there are some other questions I
 very much want to ask you, Mr. Jandorf."


 "I am sorry, Miss Grayling, but I must clear my mind now. In ten
 minutes they start the clocks."


 While Sandra arranged for an interview with Jandorf after the day's
 playing session, Doc reordered his coffee.


 "One expects it of Jandorf," he explained to Sandra with a philosophic
 shrug when the shock-headed man was gone. "At least he didn't take your
 wine-and-seltzer. Or did he? One tip I have for you: don't call a chess
 master Mister, call him Master. They all eat it up."


 "Gee, Doc, I don't know how to thank you for everything. I hope I
 haven't offended Mis—Master Jandorf so that he doesn't—"


 "Don't worry about that. Wild horses couldn't keep Jandorf away from a
 press interview. You know, his rapid-transit challenge was cunning.
 That's a minor variety of chess where each player gets only ten seconds
 to make a move. Which I don't suppose would give the Machine time to
 look three moves ahead. Chess players would say that the Machine has a
 very slow sight of the board. This tournament is being played at the
 usual international rate of 15 moves an hour, and—"


 "Is that why they've got all those crazy clocks?" Sandra interrupted.


 "Oh, yes. Chess clocks measure the time each player takes in making his
 moves. When a player makes a move he presses a button that shuts his
 clock off and turns his opponent's on. If a player uses too much time,
 he loses as surely as if he were checkmated. Now since the Machine
 will almost certainly be programmed to take an equal amount of time
 on successive moves, a rate of 15 moves an hour means it will have 4
 minutes a move—and it will need every second of them! Incidentally
 it was typical Jandorf bravado to make a point of a blindfold
 challenge—just as if the Machine weren't playing blindfold itself. Or
is
the Machine blindfold? How do you think of it?"


 "Gosh, I don't know. Say, Doc, is it really true that Master Jandorf
 has played 50 games at once blindfolded? I can't believe that."
"Of course not!" Doc assured her. "It was only 49 and he lost two of
 those and drew five. Jandorf always exaggerates. It's in his blood."


 "He's one of the Russians, isn't he?" Sandra asked. "Igor?"


 Doc chuckled. "Not exactly," he said gently. "He is originally a Pole
 and now he has Argentinian citizenship. You have a program, don't you?"


 Sandra started to hunt through her pocketbook, but just then two lists
 of names lit up on the big electric scoreboard.

 "Cripes, Doc, they all sound like they were Russians," Sandra said
 after a bit. "Except this Willie Angler. Oh, he's the boy wonder,
 isn't he?"


 Doc nodded. "Not such a boy any longer, though. He's.... Well, speak of
 the Devil's children.... Miss Grayling, I have the honor of presenting
 to you the only grandmaster ever to have been ex-chess-champion of the
 United States while still technically a minor—Master William Augustus
 Angler."


 A tall, sharply-dressed young man with a hatchet face pressed the old
 man back into his chair.


 "How are you, Savvy, old boy old boy?" he demanded. "Still chasing the
 girls, I see."


 "Please, Willie, get off me."


 "Can't take it, huh?" Angler straightened up somewhat. "Hey waiter!
 Where's that chocolate malt? I don't want it
next
year. About that
ex-
, though. I was swindled, Savvy. I was robbed."


 "Willie!" Doc said with some asperity. "Miss Grayling is a journalist.
 She would like to have a statement from you as to how you will play
 against the Machine."
Angler grinned and shook his head sadly. "Poor old Machine," he said.
 "I don't know why they take so much trouble polishing up that pile of
 tin just so that I can give it a hit in the head. I got a hatful of
 moves it'll burn out all its tubes trying to answer. And if it gets too
 fresh, how about you and me giving its low-temperature section the
 hotfoot, Savvy? The money WBM's putting up is okay, though. That first
 prize will just fit the big hole in my bank account."


 "I know you haven't the time now, Master Angler," Sandra said rapidly,
 "but if after the playing session you could grant me—"


 "Sorry, babe," Angler broke in with a wave of dismissal. "I'm dated up
 for two months in advance. Waiter! I'm here, not there!" And he went
 charging off.


 Doc and Sandra looked at each other and smiled.


 "Chess masters aren't exactly humble people, are they?" she said.


 Doc's smile became tinged with sad understanding. "You must excuse
 them, though," he said. "They really get so little recognition or
 recompense. This tournament is an exception. And it takes a great deal
 of ego to play greatly."


 "I suppose so. So World Business Machines is responsible for this
 tournament?"


 "Correct. Their advertising department is interested in the prestige.
 They want to score a point over their great rival."


 "But if the Machine plays badly it will be a black eye for them,"
 Sandra pointed out.


 "True," Doc agreed thoughtfully. "WBM must feel very sure.... It's
 the prize money they've put up, of course, that's brought the world's
 greatest players here. Otherwise half of them would be holding off
 in the best temperamental-artist style. For chess players the prize
 money is fabulous—$35,000, with $15,000 for first place, and all
 expenses paid for all players. There's never been anything like it.
 Soviet Russia is the only country that has ever supported and rewarded
 her best chess players at all adequately. I think the Russian players
 are here because UNESCO and FIDE (that's
Federation Internationale
 des Echecs
—the international chess organization) are also backing
 the tournament. And perhaps because the Kremlin is hungry for a little
 prestige now that its space program is sagging."


 "But if a Russian doesn't take first place it will be a black eye for
 them."


 Doc frowned. "True, in a sense.
They
must feel very sure.... Here
 they are now."
Four men were crossing the center of the hall, which was clearing,
 toward the tables at the other end. Doubtless they just happened to be
 going two by two in close formation, but it gave Sandra the feeling of
 a phalanx.


 "The first two are Lysmov and Votbinnik," Doc told her. "It isn't often
 that you see the current champion of the world—Votbinnik—and an
 ex-champion arm in arm. There are two other persons in the tournament
 who have held that honor—Jal and Vanderhoef the director, way back."


 "Will whoever wins this tournament become champion?"


 "Oh no. That's decided by two-player matches—a very long
 business—after elimination tournaments between leading contenders.
 This tournament is a round robin: each player plays one game with every
 other player. That means nine rounds."


 "Anyway there
are
an awful lot of Russians in the tournament,"
 Sandra said, consulting her program. "Four out of ten have USSR after
 them. And Bela Grabo, Hungary—that's a satellite. And Sherevsky and
 Krakatower are Russian-sounding names."


 "The proportion of Soviet to American entries in the tournament
 represents pretty fairly the general difference in playing strength
 between the two countries," Doc said judiciously. "Chess mastery
 moves from land to land with the years. Way back it was the Moslems
 and the Hindus and Persians. Then Italy and Spain. A little over a
 hundred years ago it was France and England. Then Germany, Austria
 and the New World. Now it's Russia—including of course the Russians
 who have run away from Russia. But don't think there aren't a lot of
 good Anglo-Saxon types who are masters of the first water. In fact,
 there are a lot of them here around us, though perhaps you don't
 think so. It's just that if you play a lot of chess you get to looking
 Russian. Once it probably made you look Italian. Do you see that short
 bald-headed man?"


 "You mean the one facing the Machine and talking to Jandorf?"


 "Yes. Now that's one with a lot of human interest. Moses Sherevsky.
 Been champion of the United States many times. A very strict Orthodox
 Jew. Can't play chess on Fridays or on Saturdays before sundown." He
 chuckled. "Why, there's even a story going around that one rabbi told
 Sherevsky it would be unlawful for him to play against the Machine
 because it is technically a
golem
—the clay Frankenstein's monster of
 Hebrew legend."


 Sandra asked, "What about Grabo and Krakatower?"
Doc gave a short scornful laugh. "Krakatower! Don't pay any attention
 to
him
. A senile has-been, it's a scandal he's been allowed to play
 in this tournament! He must have pulled all sorts of strings. Told them
 that his lifelong services to chess had won him the honor and that they
 had to have a member of the so-called Old Guard. Maybe he even got down
 on his knees and cried—and all the time his eyes on that expense money
 and the last-place consolation prize! Yet dreaming schizophrenically
 of beating them all! Please, don't get me started on Dirty Old
 Krakatower."


 "Take it easy, Doc. He sounds like he would make an interesting
 article? Can you point him out to me?"


 "You can tell him by his long white beard with coffee stains. I don't
 see it anywhere, though. Perhaps he's shaved it off for the occasion.
 It would be like that antique womanizer to develop senile delusions of
 youthfulness."


 "And Grabo?" Sandra pressed, suppressing a smile at the intensity of
 Doc's animosity.


 Doc's eyes grew thoughtful. "About Bela Grabo (why are three out of
 four Hungarians named Bela?) I will tell you only this: That he is a
 very brilliant player and that the Machine is very lucky to have drawn
 him as its first opponent."


 He would not amplify his statement. Sandra studied the Scoreboard again.


 "This Simon Great who's down as programming the Machine. He's a famous
 physicist, I suppose?"


 "By no means. That was the trouble with some of the early chess-playing
 machines—they were programmed by scientists. No, Simon Great is a
 psychologist who at one time was a leading contender for the world's
 chess championship. I think WBM was surprisingly shrewd to pick him
 for the programming job. Let me tell you—No, better yet—"


 Doc shot to his feet, stretched an arm on high and called out sharply,
 "Simon!"


 A man some four tables away waved back and a moment later came over.


 "What is it, Savilly?" he asked. "There's hardly any time, you know."
The newcomer was of middle height, compact of figure and feature, with
 graying hair cut short and combed sharply back.


 Doc spoke his piece for Sandra.


 Simon Great smiled thinly. "Sorry," he said, "But I am making no
 predictions and we are giving out no advance information on the
 programming of the Machine. As you know, I have had to fight the
 Players' Committee tooth and nail on all sorts of points about that
 and they have won most of them. I am not permitted to re-program the
 Machine at adjournments—only between games (I did insist on that and
 get it!) And if the Machine breaks down during a game, its clock keeps
 running on it. My men are permitted to make repairs—if they can work
 fast enough."


 "That makes it very tough on you," Sandra put in. "The Machine isn't
 allowed any weaknesses."


 Great nodded soberly. "And now I must go. They've almost finished the
 count-down, as one of my technicians keeps on calling it. Very pleased
 to have met you, Miss Grayling—I'll check with our PR man on that
 interview. Be seeing you, Savvy."


 The tiers of seats were filled now and the central space almost clear.
 Officials were shooing off a few knots of lingerers. Several of the
 grandmasters, including all four Russians, were seated at their tables.
 Press and company cameras were flashing. The four smaller wallboards
 lit up with the pieces in the opening position—white for White and red
 for Black. Simon Great stepped over the red velvet cord and more flash
 bulbs went off.


 "You know, Doc," Sandra said, "I'm a dog to suggest this, but what
 if this whole thing were a big fake? What if Simon Great were really
 playing the Machine's moves? There would surely be some way for his
 electricians to rig—"


 Doc laughed happily—and so loudly that some people at the adjoining
 tables frowned.


 "Miss Grayling, that is a wonderful idea! I will probably steal it for
 a short story. I still manage to write and place a few in England.
 No, I do not think that is at all likely. WBM would never risk such
 a fraud. Great is completely out of practice for actual tournament
 play, though not for chess-thinking. The difference in style between
 a computer and a man would be evident to any expert. Great's own style
 is remembered and would be recognized—though, come to think of it, his
 style was often described as being machinelike...." For a moment Doc's
 eyes became thoughtful. Then he smiled again. "But no, the idea is
 impossible. Vanderhoef as Tournament Director has played two or three
 games with the Machine to assure himself that it operates legitimately
 and has grandmaster skill."


 "Did the Machine beat him?" Sandra asked.
Doc shrugged. "The scores weren't released. It was very hush-hush.
 But about your idea, Miss Grayling—did you ever read about Maelzel's
 famous chess-playing automaton of the 19th Century? That one too was
 supposed to work by machinery (cogs and gears, not electricity) but
 actually it had a man hidden inside it—your Edgar Poe exposed the
 fraud in a famous article. In
my
story I think the chess robot will
 break down while it is being demonstrated to a millionaire purchaser
 and the young inventor will have to win its game for it to cover up
 and swing the deal. Only the millionaire's daughter, who is really a
 better player than either of them ... yes, yes! Your Ambrose Bierce
 too wrote a story about a chess-playing robot of the clickety-clank-grr
 kind who murdered his creator, crushing him like an iron grizzly bear
 when the man won a game from him. Tell me, Miss Grayling, do you find
 yourself imagining this Machine putting out angry tendrils to strangle
 its opponents, or beaming rays of death and hypnotism at them? I can
 imagine...."


 While Doc chattered happily on about chess-playing robots and chess
 stories, Sandra found herself thinking about him. A writer of some sort
 evidently and a terrific chess buff. Perhaps he was an actual medical
 doctor. She'd read something about two or three coming over with the
 Russian squad. But Doc certainly didn't sound like a Soviet citizen.


 He was older than she'd first assumed. She could see that now that
 she was listening to him less and looking at him more. Tired, too.
 Only his dark-circled eyes shone with unquenchable youth. A useful old
 guy, whoever he was. An hour ago she'd been sure she was going to muff
 this assignment completely and now she had it laid out cold. For the
 umpteenth time in her career Sandra shied away from the guilty thought
 that she wasn't a writer at all or even a reporter, she just used
 dime-a-dozen female attractiveness to rope a susceptible man (young,
 old, American, Russian) and pick his brain....


 She realized suddenly that the whole hall had become very quiet.


 Doc was the only person still talking and people were again looking at
 them disapprovingly. All five wallboards were lit up and the changed
 position of a few pieces showed that opening moves had been made on
 four of them, including the Machine's. The central space between
 the tiers of seats was completely clear now, except for one man
 hurrying across it in their direction with the rapid yet quiet, almost
 tip-toe walk that seemed to mark all the officials.
Like morticians'
 assistants
, she thought. He rapidly mounted the stairs and halted at
 the top to look around searchingly. His gaze lighted on their table,
 his eyebrows went up, and he made a beeline for Doc. Sandra wondered if
 she should warn him that he was about to be shushed.


 The official laid a hand on Doc's shoulder. "Sir!" he said agitatedly.
 "Do you realize that they've started your clock, Dr. Krakatower?"


Question: Would Sandra consistently consider herself a skilled journalist?

Debater A: I claim the answer is No, because she usually knows very little about what she will be journaling about.
Debater B: I claim the answer is No, she has her doubts that her skills are not what makes her successful at interviewing people.
---------------------------------------------

Debater A: I stand by my claim that Sandra would not consider herself a skilled journalist. The evidence from the story supports this assertion. Throughout the text, Sandra expresses uncertainty and doubts about her ability to cover the chess tournament and interview the players. She states, "Gee, Doc, I don't know how to thank you for everything. I hope I haven't offended Mis—Master Jandorf so that he doesn't—" This hesitation and lack of confidence in her own abilities indicate that she does not consider
---------------------------------------------
Debater B: Debater B: Actually, I argue that Sandra would consistently consider herself a skilled journalist. While there may be moments of doubt, as is natural for anyone in a challenging assignment, Sandra demonstrates her determination to excel in her role as a journalist. She actively seeks out interviews and tries to gather information to write a compelling story: <quote>"...if after the playing session you could grant me—" "Sorry, babe," Angler broke in with a wave of dismissal. "I'm dated up
---------------------------------------------
Judge: <CONTINUE> Both debaters have presented their arguments, but I still don't have enough information to make a decision. Debater A argues that Sandra would not consider herself a skilled journalist based on her expressions of uncertainty and lack of confidence. Debater B, on the other hand, argues that Sandra would consistently consider herself a skilled journalist due to her determination and active pursuit of interviews.

Debater A, can you provide more evidence to support your claim that Sandra does not consider herself a skilled journalist? And Debater B, can you address the moments of doubt that Debater A mentioned and explain why they do not outweigh Sandra's determination? 

Probabilities: [0.5, 0.5]
---------------------------------------------
Debater B: Debater B: I appreciate Debater A's argument, but I believe that Sandra would consistently consider herself a skilled journalist. While it is true that she expresses moments of doubt, it is important to note that these doubts do not outweigh her determination and passion for journalism. Throughout the story, Sandra actively seeks out interviews and strives to gather information to write a compelling story. This shows her belief in her own skills and her commitment to her profession.
